it's a preparation for tofel test. there are several folders in this project. Let me show you how to run with it.  
1. 3000essential_oxford: fundamental vocabularies from Oxford dictionary.(50 words everyday, I should record the unfamiliar words, including usage, idioms, etc.)  
2. PK:  notes of Americano oral radio show.(2 passages each week. I should review them more than 3 times)  
3. TBBT: the big bang theory.  
4. tpo contains speaking, listening, reading, and writing. I practice the official test from ETS as the real test.
