# Visiting Washington DC
## Dialogue 1
Mark: Whew!  You made it.  I was just about to turn in.  
> whew! 谢天谢地sth is very difficult but had finished  
> be about to do 即将要做某事  
> turn in  
> 1. 睡觉  
> 2. 回房间了  
> I am gonna turn in.  

Jingjing:  You would have stood me up?  
> stand sb up = leave sb alone = don't meet someone as plan  
> 你要放我鸽子吗？

Mark:  We'd have run into each other at the breakfast buffet.  
> buffet  
> 自助餐；（车站）快餐部；（火车）饮食柜台。  
> run into 偶遇  

Jingjing:  You mean the “continental breakfast”?    
> continental breakfast 欧陆早餐  
> 一种简单的早餐，像酒店双早  

Mark:  Oops, yeah.  Anyway, you're here, and you're looking `dead beat`.  
> dead beat 累得精疲力竭  

Jingjing:  I haven't even begun to feel jet lag, I'm that tired.  
> jet lag  
> 我还没有开始感觉时差。

Mark:  Well then, let's quickly decide which places we're going to visit tomorrow.  
> well then 接下来  

Jingjing:  Sounds simple enough.  I can't believe we both have to fly out again the day after tomorrow in the morning!  
> sounds simple enough 听上去挺简单  
> fly out 飞走  
> we stay here 2 nights

Mark:  I'm glad we could meet in Washington D.C.  `It's been ages`.  
> Washington state  
> It's been ages/years  = long time no see  

Jingjing:  Yeah.  If we both get up early, let's hit the Smithsonian after breakfast.  
> hit the Smithsonian 去国立博物馆  
> go or try sth  

Mark:  I like the sound of that. Feel free to sleep in.  If we're going to the Smithsonian at all, we'd have to give it four hours at least.  
> I like the sound of that = sound good.  
> 我喜欢你的语气  
> feel free to do sth.睡懒觉也没事。  
> sleep in 睡懒觉  
> at all 确定  
> if we're going to the Smithsonian at all 如果我们确定要去那个地方  

Jingjing:  Okay, I'm thinking the early bird gets the worm here, and that we can `play that by ear`.  
> early bird gets the worm 早起的鸟儿又虫吃。  
> play that by ear 随机应变，到时候再说（play it by ear）  

Mark:  Right.  And after we have lunch somewhere, we can check out a couple other places.  
> check out 瞧一瞧，看一看。  

Jingjing:  You know, the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial are right across from each other.  
> Memorial 纪念堂  
> MAO Zhedong Memorial  
> be right across from 在。。。对面  

Mark:  Hmm, they are close.  Um; what do you think about the White House?  

Jingjing:  I think it's more of a tourist trap.  What are your thoughts about it?  
> tourist trap 游客陷阱=敲竹杠的地方  
> rip off 欺诈  

Mark:  Well, I mean, if we're in Washington D.C., and we want to see something unlike what they have in other capital cities and historical places, maybe the White House would be our `best bet`.  
> best bet 最好的选择  

Jingjing:  You think we could get in?  

Mark:  I'm not counting on it.  What about, after the Smithsonian, we head toward the White House, eat somewhere, and go on to the Capitol Building if the White House is too packed.  
> what about 要不  
> head toward swr 直奔  
> Capitol Building 国会大厦  
> packed 拥挤的  

Jingjing:  That sounds decent.  And we can keep the monument and memorial as a backup.  
> decent 高贵的，行妙赞好  
> keep sth as a backup 把某事作为后备  

Mark: Or check it out in the evening.  Now go upstairs and crash. Your eyelids are heavier than my luggage.  
> go crash 马上睡觉
> I am going crash in the sofa.  
> eyelids 眼皮  

Jingjing:  I'm afraid I don't see what you mean.  HASTA MAÑANA.  
> HASTA MAÑANA = see you tomorrow.  

## Dialogue 2 

Jingjing:  Did you have enough to eat for lunch?  

Mark:  Um, kind of.  But I'm not that keen on filling up on snack food instead of eating at a restaurant.  
> keen on doing sth.  
> 喜欢做某事  
> fill up on sth.  
> 用。。。填饱肚子  

Jingjing:  Let's look for a restaurant when dinnertime comes.  

Mark:  Speaking of time, it looks like we'd be stuck all afternoon in this queue.  
> 我们要困在队伍里一下午了。  
> we would get stuck all afternoon in this queue.  

Jingjing:  Yeah, so this is the White House.  

Mark:  What do you say we just take some pictures here from outside?  
> what do you say ... 你觉得。。。怎么样  

Jingjing:  And forget about the tour?  
> 放弃这个游览？

Mark:  You got it.  I'm willing to bet there'll be fewer people at some of the other places.  
> 我愿意打赌其他地方人少  

Jingjing:  Sounds good.
