OK, for the first part of the experiment, well, um, we’ve always known that babies start to cry when they hear other babies crying, right?

我们已经知道当小孩子听到其他宝宝哭的时候，他们也会哭，对吧？

 Let’s talk about an experiment that may show that babies could be capable of feeling empathy.

OK, for the first part of the experiment, well, um, we’ve always known that babies start to cry when they hear

other babies crying, right? One baby in the room starts crying and all the rest join in. We’ve always assumed

that the other babies cried because they were reacting to the noise of the crying, that the noise itself was

distressing.  **So in the experiment researchers played a tape recording, a tape of babies crying, to another baby.** And **sure enough the baby started crying** when he heard the sound of other babies crying. This was no

surprise of course. **And researchers assumed that the baby cried because of the noise.**

But the next part of the experiment was surprising. **The researchers played the baby a tape of his own crying.**

Now it was just as noisy so the researchers expected him to cry. **However this time the baby did not cry. **He

wasn’t upset by the sound of his own crying. Why not? Well, maybe it wasn’t the noise that had made him cry

before when he heard other babies crying. In fact, maybe noise had nothing to do with it. It could be that the

baby felt empathy for the other babies. And that was why he got upset when he heard them crying. **The researchers concluded that it is indeed possible that babies feel empathy, concern for others.**

Some researchers think that babies may feel empathy. In the first part of the experiment, researcher played a tape recording, a tape of badies crying, to another baby. Sure enough the baby started crying. And researchers assumed that the baby cried because of the noise. In the second part of the experiment, the researchers played the baby a tape of his own crying. However, this time the baby didn't cry. So, the researchers concluded that it is indeed possible that babies feel empathy for others.
