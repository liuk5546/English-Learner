Narrator

Now listen to part ot a lecture on this topic in a business management class.

Professor

So let me tell you about my own experience with this when I was working for a computer company a couple of years ago. So one day, **a coworker and I suggested we should give our computers a design makeover**, make them look more up to date. Market research was showing that new customers said they would be more interested in buying our computers if they looked cooler. Our technology was advanced, but the outside design looked really old-fashioned.

> makeover [c,u]外观的改进或改善

At first, **more than half the group supported us**. There were a few **senior managers** there though who **didn't support the design change**. One of the senior managers said, "Our focus has always been on technology. Changing the look is an unnecessary cost." Almost immediately, **some of our supporters changed their minds**. Even my coworker changed his mind. When I asked him why after the meeting, he told me **he didn't want to make a bad impression on the senior managers**. He thought that disagreeing with them might **jeopardize his chances of getting a promotion** by not looking like a team player.

> been `[bɪn]`

What about me? I hate to admit it, but after a few hours of discussion, I started wondering if it was worth everyone's time to argue about this. As more people sided with senior management, **I started to feel like I was the only one holding up the vote. **Everyone else seemed to think change wasn't necessary, so I voted against my own idea in the end. So we unanimously decided to stay with the current old-looking design. But this decision **ended up costing us a lot of money**. That same year, our competitor came out with a new design that attracted some of our customers and prevented us from profiting on potential new customers.

让我们来说说高速公路广告牌，为一辆名叫Panther的车打广告。这个广告展示了一幅巨大的车画，在车上用大大的字母写着车的名字--Panther。

Well, to be specific, let's say there's a billboard on the highway advertising a ... car, called the 'Panther'. The ad shows a big picture of a car and above the car in huge letters is the name of the car- 'Panther'. 

> advertise vt 宣传，展现

但是问这些司机他们是否看到任何车子的广告，他们会想一会儿，然后说‘没有’

But ask those drivers later if they saw any advertisements for cars, and well, they'll think about it and a lot of them will say 'no'. 



你让他们说出以p开头的动物名字。

You ask them to name an animal starting with the letter 'p'. 



这块广告牌有影响即使这些司机没有记着曾经看过。

The billboard had an effect even though the drivers don't remember ever seeing it.
