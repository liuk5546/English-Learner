# Visiting Washington DC
## Dialogue 1
Mark: Whew!  You made it.  I was just about to turn in.  
> whew! 谢天谢地  
> be about to do 即将要做某事  
> turn in 
> 1. 睡觉  
> 2. 回房间了  
> I am gonna turn in.  

Jingjing:  You would have stood me up?  
> stand sb up = leave sb alone  

Mark:  We'd have run into each other at the breakfast buffet.  
> buffet  
> 自助餐；（车站）快餐部；（火车）饮食柜台。

Jingjing:  You mean the “continental breakfast”?    
> continental breakfast 欧陆早餐  

Mark:  Oops, yeah.  Anyway, you're here, and you're looking `dead beat`.  
> dead beat 累得精疲力竭  

Jingjing:  I haven't even begun to feel jet lag, I'm that tired.  
> jet lag 

Mark:  Well then, let's quickly decide which places we're going to visit tomorrow.  

Jingjing:  Sounds simple enough.  I can't believe we both have to fly out again the day after tomorrow in the morning!  


Mark:  I'm glad we could meet in Washington D.C.  `It's been ages`.  
> Washington state  
> It's been ages/years  = long time no see  

Jingjing:  Yeah.  If we both get up early, let's hit the Smithsonian after breakfast.  
> hit the Smithsonian 去国立博物馆  
> go or try sth  

Mark:  I like the sound of that. Feel free to sleep in.  If we're going to the Smithsonian at all, we'd have to give it four hours at least.  
> I like the sound of that = sound good.  
> sleep in 睡懒觉  
> at all 确定

Jingjing:  Okay, I'm thinking the early bird gets the worm here, and that we can `play that by ear`.  

Mark:  Right.  And after we have lunch somewhere, we can check out a couple other places.  

Jingjing:  You know, the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial are right across from each other.  

Mark:  Hmm, they are close.  Um; what do you think about the White House?  

Jingjing:  I think it's more of a tourist trap.  What are your thoughts about it?  

Mark:  Well, I mean, if we're in Washington D.C., and we want to see something unlike what they have in other capital cities and historical places, maybe the White House would be our best bet.  

Jingjing:  You think we could get in?  

Mark:  I'm not counting on it.  What about, after the Smithsonian, we head toward the White House, eat somewhere, and go on to the Capitol Building if the White House is too packed.  

Jingjing:  That sounds decent.  And we can keep the monument and memorial as a backup.  

Mark: Or check it out in the evening.  Now go upstairs and crash. Your eyelids are heavier than my luggage.  

Jingjing:  I'm afraid I don't see what you mean.  HASTA MAÑANA.  

## Dialogue 2 

Jingjing:  Did you have enough to eat for lunch?  

Mark:  Um, kind of.  But I'm not that keen on filling up on snack food instead of eating at a restaurant.  

Jingjing:  Let's look for a restaurant when dinnertime comes.  

Mark:  Speaking of time, it looks like we'd be stuck all afternoon in this queue.  

Jingjing:  Yeah, so this is the White House.  

Mark:  What do you say we just take some pictures here from outside?  

Jingjing:  And forget about the tour?  

Mark:  You got it.  I'm willing to bet there'll be fewer people at some of the other places.  

Jingjing:  Sounds good.
