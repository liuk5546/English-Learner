**真的吗？我坐过这些巴士，有的时候他们只有一些人。确实是一种浪费**

  Really? I’ve ridden those buses, and sometimes there were only a few people on the bus. It did seem like kind of a waste

**我认为问题出在路线太老了，巴士只经过非常昂贵的社区，学生住不起。学校还没有改变路线是非常可笑的。所以巴士现在要去校外住宿学生住的地方。我想如果他们这样做了，会有很多学生坐这些巴士。**

 I think the problem is the route’s out-of-date. It only goes through the neighborhoods that’ve gotten too expensive for students to live in. It’s ridiculous that they haven’t already changed the route—you know, so it goes where most off-campus students live now. I bet if they did that, they’d get plenty of students riding those buses.

**停止校车服务和增加停车位只会鼓励更多的学生在学校里开车。这只会增加学校周围的噪声和交通拥堵。并且这会增加更多的停车位需求**

  Cutting back the bus service and adding parking’s just gonna encourage more students to drive on campus. And that’ll just add to the noise around campus and create more traffic. and that’ll increase the need for more parking spaces.

我确定我不能在我的工作日计划中加入任何东西了。我每晚都要游泳练习。

是的，并且就开销而言，我认为他们正在走一条弯路。我的意思是，晚课花钱雇佣更多的老师和让教学楼开得更晚，这比简简单单地买更多的计算机贵得多。

  Right, and as far as expense goes, I think they are going about it the wrong way. I mean, it cost money to hire more teachers and keep the academic building open later, which is a lot more expensive than just simply buying more computers.

是的，电脑价格这两年已经降了。所以系里面将不会花像以前一样多的钱（采购电脑了）。

  That's right. Computer prices have come way down the past few years. So the department wont have to spend as much now as they did in the past.
