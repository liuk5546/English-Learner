# Variation in the Climate

## ERROR[4]

One of the most difficult aspects of deciding whether current climatic events reveal evidence of the impact of human activities is that it is hard to get a measure of what constitutes the natural variability of the climate.We know that `over the past millennia` the climate has undergone major changes without any significant human intervention. We also know that the global climate system is `immensely` complicated and that everything is in some way connected, and so the system is capable of fluctuating in unexpected ways. **We need therefore to know how much the climate can vary of its own accord in order to interpret with confidence the extent to which recent changes are natural as opposed to being the result of human activities. ** 

当前的气象事件是否揭示人类活动影响的证据

难以测量什么是气候的自然多变性。在过去的几千年，气候在没有人干预的情况下，已经经历了重大变化。我们也知道，全球气候系统非常复杂，并且之中所有的事物以某种方式相连接，所以系统可以以预想不到的方式变化。

Instrumental records do not go back far enough to provide us with reliable measurements of global climatic variability on timescales longer than a century. What we do know is that as we include longer time intervals, the record shows increasing evidence of slow `swings` in climate between different regimes. To build up a better picture of fluctuations appreciably further back in time requires us to use proxy records.

仪器记录不能记录足够长时间的的可靠记录。仪器记录展示了气候缓慢变化的证据。建立一张更好的变化图要我们使用代理记录。

Over long periods of time, **substances** whose physical and chemical properties change with the ambient climate at the time **can be deposited in a systematic way** to provide a continuous record of changes in those properties overtime, sometimes for hundreds or thousands of years.

Generally, the layering occurs on an annual basis, hence the observed changes in the records can be dated. Information on temperature, rainfall, and other aspects of the climate that can be inferred from the systematic changes in properties is usually referred to as proxy data. Proxy temperature records have been reconstructed from ice core drilled out of the central Greenland ice cap, `calcite` shells embedded in layered lake sediments in Western Europe, ocean floor sediment cores from the tropical Atlantic Ocean, ice cores from Peruvian glaciers, and ice cores from eastern Antarctica. While these records provide broadly consistent indications that temperature variations can occur on a global scale, there are `nonetheless` some `intriguing` differences, which suggest that the pattern of temperature variations in regional climates can also differ significantly from each other.

通常，分层是按年发生的，因此在记录中可观察到的改变可以被确定年代。温度、降雨和其他天气的方面可以系统地从性质的改变中推断出来，这就是经常讲的proxy data。代理温度记录已经从格陵兰岛中部被钻开的冰核中，埋藏在西欧分层的湖底沉淀物中的方解石贝壳，热带大西洋的海底沉淀物中，被重建。这些记录提供了广泛的连续指标：温度的多样性可以发生在全球范围内。尽管如此，还是由一些有趣的差异，温度多样性变化的模式地区与地区之间也可以非常不同。

What the proxy records make abundantly clear is that there have been significant natural changes in the climate over timescales longer than a few thousand years. Equally striking, however, is the relative stability of the climate in the past 10.000 years (the Holocene period).

proxy记录讲清楚的是超过几千年的时间，气候自然地显著变化。然而，同样惊人的是在过去的一万年气候是相对稳定的。



To the extent that the `coverage` of the global climate from these records can provide a `measure` of its true variability, it should at least indicate how all the natural causes of climate change have combined. These include the chaotic fluctuations of the atmosphere, the slower but equally erratic behavior of the oceans, changes in the land surfaces, and the extent of ice and snow. Also included will be any variations that have arisen from volcanic activity, solar activity, and, possibly, human activities.

One way to estimate how all the various processes leading to climate variability will combine is by using computer models of the global climate. They can do only so much to represent the full complexity of the global climate and hence may give only limited information about natural variability. Studies suggest that to date the variability in computer simulations is considerably smaller than in data obtained from the proxy records.

估计所有导致气候变化的过程如何结合在一起的一个方法是使用全球气候计算机模型。计算机模型只可以展示全球气候的全部复杂性，因此只能给出自然变化的有限的信息。研究表明在计算机模拟中记录变化比从代理记录中获取数据要小很多。

In addition to the internal variability of the global climate system itself, there is the added factor of external influences, such as volcanoes and solar activity .There is a growing body of opinion that both these physical variations have a measurable impact on the climate. Thus we need to be able to include these in our `deliberations`. Some current analyses conclude that volcanoes and solar activity explain quite a considerable amount of the observed variability in the period from the seventeenth to the early twentieth century’s, but that they cannot be `invoked` to explain the rapid warming in recent decades.

一些现在的分析认为火山和太阳活动解释了大量的可观察变化，但是他们不能被引用解释最近几十年迅速变暖。
