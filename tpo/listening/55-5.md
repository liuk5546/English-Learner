Okay. The aurora.The aurora refers to the rays of bright colors in the night sky near the North and South Poles. In the Northern Hemisphere, it’s called the aurora borealis. And in the Southern Hemisphere, it’s called the aurora australis. You’ve probably seen pictures of it.It’s quite beautiful.It took centuries to figure out what’s behind these beautiful colors in the night skies. 

aurora 是在南北极夜晚附近发生的明亮的颜色射线。

In the early 1700s, scientists proposed that there was an electric current that stretched between the North and South Poles, and that if this electric current was disturbed, an aurora would form.Others postulated that the phenomenon was caused by light that refracted off glaciers and snow in the Arctic.
