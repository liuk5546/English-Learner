# Variation in the Climate

One of the most difficult aspects of deciding whether current climatic events reveal evidence of the impact of human activities is that it is hard to get a measure of what constitutes the natural variability of the climate.We know that `over the past millennia` the climate has undergone major changes without any significant human intervention. We also know that the global climate system is `immensely` complicated and that everything is in some way connected, and so the system is capable of fluctuating in unexpected ways. **We need therefore to know how much the climate can vary of its own accord in order to interpret with confidence the extent to which recent changes are natural as opposed to being the result of human activities. **

Over long periods of time, **substances** whose physical and chemical properties change with the ambient climate at the time **can be deposited in a systematic way** to provide a continuous record of changes in those properties overtime, sometimes for hundreds or thousands of years.

Generally, the layering occurs on an annual basis, hence the observed changes in the records can be dated. Information on temperature, rainfall, and other aspects of the climate that can be inferred from the systematic changes in properties is usually referred to as proxy data. Proxy temperature records have been reconstructed from ice core drilled out of the central Greenland ice cap, calcite shells embedded in layered lake sediments in Western Europe, ocean floor sediment cores from the tropical Atlantic Ocean, ice cores from Peruvian glaciers, and ice cores from eastern Antarctica. While these records provide broadly consistent indications that temperature variations can occur on a global scale, there are nonetheless some intriguing differences, which suggest that the pattern of temperature variations in regional climates can also differ significantly from each other.
