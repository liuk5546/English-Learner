Then you will write a parper that is not so much about the observations,
 but a synthesis of what you have observed and read.  
be not so much about..., but.... 不仅仅跟。。。有关还和。。。有关  

Actually, after your first observation, you'll go back and `look through` 
your textbook and find a few sources concerning the stage of development 
this particular child is in.  
> look through 通读
>this particular child is in the stage of development.

And then with that knowledge, you will make a second observation of the 
same child to see if these expected developmental behaviors are exhibited.  
然后用这些知识，你将会第二次观察这个孩子来验证这些期待的发展行为是否会出现。  

If you observed a 4 year-old child, for example, my daughter is 4 years old;
 you might read up on Piaget's stages of cognitive development we covered those
  in class.
  
What stage would a child of that age be in? pre-operational stage.  
If that's the case, her languages use would be maturing and her memory and 
imagination would be developed.  
如果是这样的话，她的语言使用将会日渐成熟，她的想象力也将会被开发出来。  

Your paper should compare what is expected of children at certain stages of 
development with what you actually observed.  
> compare A with B.  
>expect sth of sb  
>Are you clear what is expected of you?
