My Anwser:  
&emsp;&emsp;I think television has had a positive `influence` on society. Because it's a good way to get information before the computer was born. For example, I still `remember` when I was young I didn't have a personal computer. At that time, the only way I can get science knowledge was an education TV program on Saturday night. And you know because of that program, I decided to major in Computer Science in College I guess. And There were a lot of people like me who were stronly influenced by tv series and then make their career decision at that age in China.  

Referrence:  
Television, which is often termed as the ‘idiot box’ by many, is one of the most important electronic media devices today. Almost every house today owns a television set and it has surely become one of the most important parts of our lives. Earlier, it used to be only a means of entertainment because of the movies, music and shows that are put up with an intention of entertaining the viewers. But more than just entertaining, televisions have come a long way in benefiting its viewers and audience.
