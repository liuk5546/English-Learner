# Mystery of Yawning

## error[1，4，8，14]

According to conventional theory, yawning takes place when people are bored or sleepy and serves the function of increasing alertness by reversing, through deeper breathing, the drop in blood oxygen levels that are caused by the shallow breathing that accompanies lack of sleep or boredom. Unfortunately, the few scientific investigations of yawning have failed to find any connection between how often someone yawns and how much sleep they have had or how tired they are. About the closest any research has come to supporting the tiredness theory is to confirm that adults yawn more often on weekdays than on weekends, and that school children yawn more frequently in their first year at primary school than they do in kindergarten.

不幸运的是，少量打哈欠的科学调查没有找到人们打哈欠的频率和睡多少或有多累之间的关系。在所有支持疲惫理论的研究中，最相关的一个是确定了成年人在工作日打哈欠要比周末多，学生打哈欠在小学一年级要比托儿班多。

Another flaw of the tiredness theory is that yawning does not raise alertness or physiological activity, as the theory would predict. When researchers measured the heart rate, muscle tension and skin `conductance` of people before, during, and after yawning, they did detect some changes in skin conductance following yawning, indicating a slight increase in physiological activity. However, similar changes occurred when the subjects were asked simply to open their mouths or to breathe deeply. Yawning did nothing special to their state of physiological activity. (前面证明的是打哈欠不会提高生理活动，后面证明的是对血氧下降和血液中二氧化碳含量导致打哈欠的否定)Experiments have also cast serious doubt on the belief that yawning is triggered by a drop in blood oxygen or a rise in blood carbon dioxide. Volunteers were told to think about yawning while they breathed either normal air, pure oxygen, or an air mixture with an above-normal level of carbon dioxide. If the theory was correct, breathing air with extra carbon dioxide should have triggered yawning, while breathing pure oxygen should have suppressed yawning. In fact, neither condition made any difference to the frequency of yawning, which remained constant at about 24 yawns per hour. Another experiment demonstrated that physical exercise, which was sufficiently vigorous to double the rate of breathing, had no effect on the frequency of yawning. Again, the `implication` is that yawning has little or nothing to do with oxygen.

打哈欠没有提高警觉性或生理活动。changes in skin conductance 同样发生在对象张嘴或者深呼吸的时候。实验怀疑血氧降低或血液中的二氧化碳上升导致了打哈欠。当实验对象呼吸正常空气，纯氧和高于正常水平的二氧化碳的空气混合物，他们被要求命令想着打哈欠。如果理论正确，二氧化碳超标会触发打哈欠。事实上，没有一个情况改变打哈欠的频率。另外一个实验展示体育锻炼不会影响打哈欠的频率。

A completely different theory holds that yawning assists in the physical development of the lungs early in life, but has no remaining biological function in adults. It has been suggested that yawning and hiccupping might serve to clear out the fetus's airways. The lungs of a fetus secrete a liquid that mixes with its mother's amniotic fluid. Babies with congenital blockages that prevent this fluid from escaping from their lungs are sometimes born with deformed lungs. It might be that yawning helps to clear out the lungs by periodically lowering the pressure in them. According to this theory, yawning in adults is just a developmental fossil with no biological function. But, while accepting that not everything in life can be explained by Darwinian evolution, there are sound reasons for being skeptical of theories like this one, which avoid the issue of what yawning does for adults. Yawning is distracting, consumes energy and takes time. It is almost certainly doing something significant in adults as well as in fetuses. What could it be?

The empirical evidence, such as it is, suggests an altogether different function for yawning-namely, that yawning prepares us for a change in activity level. Support for this theory came from a study of yawning behavior in everyday life. Volunteers wore wrist-mounted devices that automatically recorded their physical activity for up to two weeks; the volunteers also recorded their yawns by pressing a button on the device each time they yawned. The data showed that yawning tended to occur about 15 minutes before a period of increased behavioral activity. Yawning bore no relationship to sleep patterns, however. This accords with anecdotal evidence that people often yawn in situations where they are neither tired nor bored, but are preparing for `impending` mental and physical activity. Such yawning is often referred to as "incongruous" because it seems out of place, at least on the tiredness view:soldiers yawning before combat, musicians yawning before performing, and athletes yawning before competing. Their yawning seems to have nothing to do with sleepiness or boredom-quite the reverse-but it does precede a change in activity level.

### complex sentences

According to conventional theory, yawning takes place when people are bored or sleepy and serves the function of increasing alertness by reversing, through deeper breathing, the `drop` in blood oxygen levels that are caused by the shallow breathing that accompanies lack of sleep or boredom. 

根据有争议的理论，打哈欠发生在人们无聊或者困的时候，并且增加警觉的功效，通过深呼吸反转血氧等级下降。这种下降由缺少睡眠和无聊伴随着的浅呼吸导致。

> drop [c] 下降，减少

Yawning, according to the conventional theory, is caused by boredom or lack of sleep and can be avoided through deeper breathing.

打哈欠由无聊或缺睡导致，可以通过深呼吸预防

The conventional theory is that people yawn when bored or sleepy because yawning raises blood oxygen levels, which in turn raises alertness.

人们无聊或困的时候打哈欠，因为打哈欠提高血氧，增强警觉性。

About the closest any research has come to supporting the tiredness theory is to confirm that adults yawn more often on weekdays than on weekends, and that school children yawn more frequently in their first year at primary school than they do in kindergarten.
