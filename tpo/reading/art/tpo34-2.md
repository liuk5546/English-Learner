 This came about from two major developments: paper became common, replacing `parchment` as the major medium for writing, and `rounded scripts` were regularized and perfected so that they replaced the `angular scripts` of the previous period, which because of their `angularity` were uneven in height. Books became major `vehicles` for artistic expression, and the artists who produced them, notably calligraphers and painters, enjoyed high status, and their workshops were often `sponsored` by princes and their courts.

伊斯兰艺术发展是由于两大进步：1、纸张变得普遍；2、书籍成为主要的艺术表达手段。

Before A.D.900, manuscripts of the Koran (the book containing the teachings of the Islamic religion) seem to have been the most common type of book produced and decorated, but after that date a wide range of books were produced for a broad spectrum of patrons. These continued to include, of course, manuscripts of the Koran, which every Muslim wanted to read, but scientific works, histories, romances, and epic and lyric poetry were also copied in fine handwriting and decorated with beautiful illustrations. Most were made for sale on the open market, and cities boasted special souks (markets) where books were bought and sold. The `mosque` of Marrakech in Morocco is known as the Kutubiyya, or Booksellers' Mosque, after the adjacent market. Some of the most luxurious books were specific `commissions` made at the order of a particular prince and signed by the calligrapher and decorator.

公元900之前，Koran的手稿曾经是最常见的书籍类型。公元900之后由于大量的赞助商，大量书籍被制造。Koran的手稿，科学成果，历史书籍，浪漫主义书籍，史诗和抒情诗。大多数在公共市场制作售卖以及城市有买卖图书的special souks。
