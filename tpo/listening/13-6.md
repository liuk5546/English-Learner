OK, I want to `go over` the different types of meteorites and what we’ve learned about them from the formation of earth and the solar system.Uh, the thing is, what’s especially interesting about meteorites is that they come from interplanetary space, but they consist of the same chemical elements that are in matter originating on earth, just in different proportions.

But that makes it easier to identify something as a meteorite `as opposed to` just a terrestrial rock.So to talk about where meteorites come from, we need to talk about comets and asteroids, which basically, they are basically made up of `debris` left over from the origin of the solar system 4. 6 billion years ago.
