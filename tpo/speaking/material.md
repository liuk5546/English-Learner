**真的吗？我坐过这些巴士，有的时候他们只有一些人。确实是一种浪费**

  Really? I’ve ridden those buses, and sometimes there were only a few people on the bus. It did seem like kind of a waste

**我认为问题出在路线太老了，巴士只经过非常昂贵的社区，学生住不起。学校还没有改变路线是非常可笑的。所以巴士现在要去校外住宿学生住的地方。我想如果他们这样做了，会有很多学生坐这些巴士。**

 I think the problem is the route’s out-of-date. It only goes through the neighborhoods that’ve gotten too expensive for students to live in. It’s ridiculous that they haven’t already changed the route—you know, so it goes where most off-campus students live now. I bet if they did that, they’d get plenty of students riding those buses.

**停止校车服务和增加停车位只会鼓励更多的学生在学校里开车。这只会增加学校周围的噪声和交通拥堵。并且这会增加更多的停车位需求**

  Cutting back the bus service and adding parking’s just gonna encourage more students to drive on campus. And that’ll just add to the noise around campus and create more traffic. and that’ll increase the need for more parking spaces.

我确定我不能在我的工作日计划中加入任何东西了。我每晚都要游泳练习。

是的，并且就开销而言，我认为他们正在走一条弯路。我的意思是，晚课花钱雇佣更多的老师和让教学楼开得更晚，这比简简单单地买更多的计算机贵得多。

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  Right, and as far as expense goes, I think they are going about it the wrong way. I mean, it cost money to hire more teachers and keep the academic building open later, which is a lot more expensive than just simply buying more computers.

是的，电脑价格这两年已经降了。所以系里面将不会花像以前一样多的钱（采购电脑了）。

  That's right. Computer prices have come way down the past few years. So the department wont have to spend as much now as they did in the past.

大学认为只要为晚餐支付一点点额外的费用为了购买将被需要的特别美食家食品材料。

The university announce that it will charge a small additional fees for these dinners in order to pay for the special gourmet food ingredient that will be requiered.

我的堂妹多年前是这个项目的学生，她说在那样的环境下为一大帮人做饭和给同学做饭很不一样。

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  My cousin was in the program a few years ago, and she said that it’s very different to cook for a lot people in that kind of atmosphere than to cook for classmates.
</details>

当然这些学生他们将会做非常好吃的食物，并且将会比出去到哪些饭店中的一家吃便宜。所以你知道这超值。这顿饭会像哪些昂贵的餐厅一样好

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  Well, these students, they’ll be making fantastic meals and it’s gonna be cheaper than going out to one of those restaurants. So, you know, it would be worth it. The meal will be as good as the ones in those expensive restaurants.

你看，这些他们削减的课程都是选修课。必修的课程几乎都是绘画，他们占用了我们大量的时间。我们真正想要的是不同的必修课。然后我们主修学生可以上大量更好的课程，所有的课都是我们喜欢的。

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  See, the classes they are eliminating are all optional. The required courses are mostly painting and drawing and they take up all our time. What we really need are different requirements. Then our majors could take a better variety of classes, all the things are interested in.

> The table takes up too much room.

 但是依旧，他们太极端了。如果钱是一个问题，他们可以雇佣一个兼职教授。又或者，大多数系里面的教师有第二领域。

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  But still, they are being drastic. If money is the problem, they could hire a part-time professor, Or, most of the professors in the department have secondary fields.

首先很多学生并不想午餐时间休息。他们边吃饭边学习，特别是考试临近或者他们必须要完成的作业。现在他们不能集中精力。音乐将会非常令人分心。

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  Well, first of all, a lot of kids arent `looking for` a relaxing break at lunch time. They like to study while they eat, especially if they have exams coming up or some assignment they have to get done. And now they won't be able to concentrate. This is gonna be very distracting.

我认为，学生将会更可能带他们的mp3，因为为了播放他们自己的音乐盖过经典音乐。

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  I think people are going to be even more likely to bring their mp3 player, you know, to play their own music and block out the classical stuff.

The business studies department at State University decide to require all students complete one semester of work experience in a local corporation or a small business.

secure permanent employment.

​								 `[ɪmˈplɔɪmənt]`

获得永久的工作

他们宣传关于领导力和组织能力的提升，但是那不是你认为的那种工作。比如我的哥哥有一份他们讲的工作，你只是在那里做一些基础任务，像打字和将文件归档，一点意义都没有。

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  Well, they talked about leadership and organizational skills, but that’s not really the kind of work you do. Like my elder brothers have the kind of jobs they are talking about and typically you are just there to do basic tasks, like typing or filing stuff, nothing very meaningful.
</details>

问题是许多这个地区的大学有相同的要求，所以很多学生都在一个职务（都有过实习经历）。所以即使当你还是学生的时候在公司有一个这样的职位，一旦你毕业了，永久工作的竞争力将是不可能的。我的意思没有足够的工作给所有这个城市想找全职工作的商科毕业生

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  Well, the problem is that there are lots of other universities in our area that have the same requirement, so there are lots of other students at these positions.So even if you `take a position` like this in a company while you are still a student, once you graduate, the competition for permanent jobs will be impossible. I mean there just won’t be enough jobs available for all the business graduates in the city who will be looking for full time work.

但是那里经常非常拥挤，人群来来往往。不适合展示艺术品。想象你站在那里，尝试欣赏一幅画。将会有百万人走过。人们从你的前面走过，挡住你的视线，打扰你...这么多人走动，你将不能欣赏这幅艺术作品，也无法欣赏任何东西。

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  But it’s always really crowded with people coming and going. It’s not good for showing artwork. Imagine you are standing there, trying to look at a painting. There’s gonna be like a million people walking through, people walking in front of you, blocking your view, distracting you… You won’t be able to appreciate the artwork, or get a good look at anything with so much going on, with so many people moving around.
</details>

但是这种光都来自窗外的自然光？事实上这样的光不好，因为如果外面是大晴天，光就太亮了。如果是阴天，就太暗了。你想要的是可控的，连续的光源，那种来自电灯泡的光。想象在一个艺术博物馆中，你有点光源，并且光被小心地控制在一样的等级。

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  but that kind of light, all that natural light from windows? That’s actually not good because if it’s really sunny out, it’ll be way too bright. If it’s cloudy, it’ll be way too dark.What you want is controlled light, consistent light, the kind you get from electric light bulbs. Think about in an art museum. In an art museum, you’ve got electric lighting, and the light is always carefully controlled, always at the same level.
