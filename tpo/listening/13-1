Then you will write a parper that is not so much about the observations,
 but a synthesis of what you have observed and read.  
be not so much about..., but.... 不仅仅跟。。。有关还和。。。有关  

Actually, after your first observation, you'll go back and `look through` 
your textbook and find a few sources concerning the stage of development 
this particular child is in.  
> look through 通读
>this particular child is in the stage of development.

And then with that knowledge, you will make a second observation of the 
same child to see if these expected developmental behaviors are exhibited.  
然后用这些知识，你将会第二次观察这个孩子来验证这些期待的发展行为是否会出现。  

If you observed a 4 year-old child, for example, my daughter is 4 years old;
 you might read up on Piaget's stages of cognitive development we covered those
  in class.
