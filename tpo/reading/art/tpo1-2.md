In seeking to describe the origins of theater, one must rely primarily on `speculation`, since there is little `concrete` evidence on which to `draw`. The most widely accepted theory, championed by anthropologists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, `envisions` theater `as` emerging out of myth and ritual. The process `perceived` by these anthropologists may be summarized briefly. During the early `stages` of *its* development, a society becomes aware of forces that appear to influence or control its food supply and well-being. **Having little understanding of natural causes, it attributes both desirable and undesirable occurrences to supernatural or magical forces, and it searches for means to win the favor of these forces. **Perceiving an apparent connection between certain actions performed by the group and the result it desires, the group repeats, refines, and formalizes those actions into fixed ceremonies, or rituals.

剧院的起源，主要靠假设，应为没具体证据研究。剧院来源于神话和宗教。在早期社会发展的舞台，它意识到看起来影响和控制社会的食物供应和健康的力量。人们对自然因素一无所知，这将欲望和非欲望的事情归因于超自然和魔法的力量。并且社会寻找能战胜这些力量的方法。
