# Variation in the Climate

One of the most difficult aspects of deciding whether current climatic events reveal evidence of the impact of human activities is that it is hard to get a measure of what constitutes the natural variability of the climate.We know that `over the past millennia` the climate has undergone major changes without any significant human intervention. We also know that the global climate system is `immensely` complicated and that everything is in some way connected, and so the system is capable of fluctuating in unexpected ways. **We need therefore to know how much the climate can vary of its own accord in order to interpret with confidence the extent to which recent changes are natural as opposed to being the result of human activities. **

Over long periods of time, **substances** whose physical and chemical properties change with the ambient climate at the time **can be deposited in a systematic way** to provide a continuous record of changes in those properties overtime, sometimes for hundreds or thousands of years.

Generally, the layering occurs on an annual basis, hence the observed changes in the records can be dated. Information on temperature, rainfall, and other aspects of the climate that can be inferred from the systematic changes in properties is usually referred to as proxy data. Proxy temperature records have been reconstructed from ice core drilled out of the central Greenland ice cap, `calcite` shells embedded in layered lake sediments in Western Europe, ocean floor sediment cores from the tropical Atlantic Ocean, ice cores from Peruvian glaciers, and ice cores from eastern Antarctica. While these records provide broadly consistent indications that temperature variations can occur on a global scale, there are `nonetheless` some `intriguing` differences, which suggest that the pattern of temperature variations in regional climates can also differ significantly from each other.

通常，分层是按年发生的，因此在记录中可观察到的改变可以被确定年代。温度、降雨和其他天气的方面可以系统地从性质的改变中推断出来，这就是经常讲的proxy data。代理温度记录已经从格陵兰岛中部被钻开的冰核中，埋藏在西欧分层的湖底沉淀物中的方解石贝壳，热带大西洋的海底沉淀物中，被重建。这些记录提供了广泛的连续指标：温度的多样性可以发生在全球范围内。尽管如此，还是由一些有趣的差异，温度多样性变化的模式地区与地区之间也可以非常不同。

What the proxy records make abundantly clear is that there have been significant natural changes in the climate over timescales longer than a few thousand years. Equally striking, however, is the relative stability of the climate in the past 10.000 years (the Holocene period).

proxy记录讲清楚的是超过几千年的时间，气候自然地显著变化。然而，同样惊人的是在过去的一万年气候是相对稳定的。



To the extent that the `coverage` of the global climate from these records can provide a `measure` of its true variability, it should at least indicate how all the natural causes of climate change have combined. These include the chaotic fluctuations of the atmosphere, the slower but equally erratic behavior of the oceans, changes in the land surfaces, and the extent of ice and snow. Also included will be any variations that have arisen from volcanic activity, solar activity, and, possibly, human activities.

In addition to the internal variability of the global climate system itself, there is the added factor of external influences, such as volcanoes and solar activity .There is a growing body of opinion that both these physical variations have a measurable impact on the climate. Thus we need to be able to include these in our `deliberations`. Some current analyses conclude that volcanoes and solar activity explain quite a considerable amount of the observed variability in the period from the seventeenth to the early twentieth century’s, but that they cannot be `invoked` to explain the rapid warming in recent decades.
