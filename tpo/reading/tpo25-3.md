# The Evolutionary Origin of Plants

The evolutionary history of plants has been `marked` by a series of adaptations. The ancestors of plants were `photosynthetic` single-celled organisms probably similar to today’s algae. Like modern algae, the organisms that `gave rise to` plants `presumably` lacked true roots, stems, leaves, and complex `reproductive` structures such as flowers. All of these features appeared later in the evolutionary history of plants. Of today’s different groups of algae, green algae are probably the most similar to ancestral plants. This `supposition` stems from the close `phylogenetic` (natural evolutionary) relationship between the two groups. DNA comparisons have shown that green algae are plants’ closest living relatives. In addition, other lines of evidence support the hypothesis that land plants evolved from ancestral green algae: green algae used the same type of `chlorophyll` and `accessory pigments` in photosynthesis as do land plants. This would not be true of red and brown algae. Green algae store food as `starch`, as do land plants and have cell walls made of `cellulose`, similar in composition to those of land plants. Again, the food storage and cell wall molecules of red and brown algae are different.

植物祖先是单细胞光合作用的生物，可能与今天的藻类相似。像现代藻类，这些带来植物的生物可能缺少真根，茎，叶和复杂的生殖结构，比如花。这些特征在后来的植物进化史中都出现了。绿藻和古代植物最为相像。这个假设来自两个种群的自然进化关系。DNA比较证实绿藻是植物最亲密的亲戚。
