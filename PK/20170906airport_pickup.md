# Airport Pickup  

##Dialogue 1  

Mark:  Hello, are you Jingjing?  

Jingjing:  Yes.  Mark Karon, I presume.  
> presume 猜  

Mark:  That's what it says on the sign. 
> sign [sain] 

Jingjing:  Do you have any more luggage to pick up?  
> pick up luggage  
> 拿行李  
> luggage 【u】

Mark:  No, I just have these two carry-on bags.  I don't think we'll be needing that hand truck.  But thanks anyway for having one ready for me.  Were you waiting here long?  
> carry-on bags 随身包  
> hand truck 手推车  

Jingjing:  No, I got here just a little while ago.  

Mark:  So, you got my text about the flight delay.  
> flight delay 飞机延误  

Jingjing:  I did.  It was good of you to send that.  
> 很感谢您发短信。  

Mark: No problem.  I know how it feels to wait for people who are late.  Hey, that's why I suggested just meeting you at the office.  
> 

Jingjing:  Well, it's my pleasure to pick you up.  Our leader insisted that someone be here as your guide.
> 西方称boss  
> guide `[ɡaɪd]`

Mark:  Your leader, eh?  Is that your boss?  
> 您的领导？那个就是你们老板吗？  

Jingjing:  She's my boss's boss.  You'll probably meet her tomorrow evening.  
> probably adv. `[ˈprɑːbəbli]`

Mark:  Oh, I thought we were having a meeting tomorrow at the office.  

Jingjing:  I'm not sure what we'll be doing tomorrow.  I'll get information later tonight and text it to you.  Anyway, here's where we'll get picked up by the company car.
> I'm not sure 代替 I don't know  

## Dialogue 2 
Jingjing:  Are you comfortable enough?  

Mark:  Yes.  Thanks.  This is a lot better than the tiny seat I had on the plane.  
> tiny seat  
> plane `[pleɪn]`  

Jingjing:  Good.  So, I'm assuming you'd like to turn in as soon as we get to the hotel.  Can I go ahead and send you the text with ideas for tomorrow's activities as soon as I get it?

> assume = guess  
> turn in  
> 睡觉，回房  
> go ahead  
> 直接做某事  

Mark:  Of course.  Send it anytime.  If I'm sleeping, I'll have my phone on DND.  
> DND = do not disturb  
> 勿扰模式  

Jingjing:  Perfect.  So, I was told your company was sending someone from research and development.  Is that your department?  
> 太好了。我被告知你的公司派遣来自研发中心的人。这是你的部门吗？  

Mark:  Um, no, I'm actually in logistics.  You'll definitely be meeting some R&D people down the road.  I know that's where you would like to cooperate.  
> logistics 物流  
> sb'll definitely be doing sth.  
> 你一定会做某事。  
> down the road 接下来 = in the feture  

Jingjing:  Oh, well, logistics is very interesting.  I'm sure we could learn a lot from you.  

Mark:  I'll do my best.  I know we wanted to send an R&D guy to meet with your company.  But they're all tied up in a project that's heading into production. 
> be tied up in a project 忙项目不可开交  
> I was tied up in my paper that time.  
> be heading into production  
> 即将投产  

Jingjing:  I understand that's when you'd want to have all your people around.  How did you get put on this trip to Beijing?  
> have all your people around  
> 重要的相关人员都在场  
> How did you get put on this trip to Beijing?    
> 你是如何成行北京的

Mark:  Well, one of the reasons is my company wanted to send someone neutral.  
> neutral `[ˈnuːtrəl]`  
> 中立的  

Jingjing:  How do you mean?  
> 这是何意？

Mark:  To be frank, we weren't sure what all you had in mind for our future cooperation.  Of course, we're very optimistic.  But we didn't want to send one of our engineers or researchers, because he or she might have too many preconceived notions about technology transfer.
> preconceived `[ˌpriːkənˈsiːvd]`  
> 事先形成的  

Jingjing:  So, you've come here as a better listener, to see what it is we have in mind?  


Mark:  Well, I wouldn't say better.  I hope we can put together a draft proposal, in a little more detail and with a little more understanding than we might have done over email.  
> proposal `[prəˈpoʊzl] `  
> n. 提议  
> might have down  
> 本可以做  

Jingjing:  That sounds doable.  Oh, here's your hotel.
