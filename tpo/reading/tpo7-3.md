#Agriculture, Iron, and the Bantu Peoples  
## 农业，钢铁和班图人  
There is evidence of agriculture in Africa prior to 3000 B.C. It may have developed independently, but many scholars believe that the spread of agriculture and iron throughout Africa linked it to the major centers of the Near East and Mediterranean world. The drying up of what is now the Sahara desert had pushed many peoples to the south into sub-Sahara Africa. These peoples settled at first in scattered `hunting-and-gathering bands`, although in some places near lakes and rivers, people who fished, with a more secure food supply, lived in larger population concentrations. Agriculture seems to have reached these people from the Near East, since the first domesticated crops were millets and sorghums whose origins are not African but west Asian. Once the idea of planting `diffused`, Africans began to develop their own crops, such as certain varieties of rice, and **they demonstrated a continued receptiveness to new imports（并且他们一直愿意接受新的外来作物）**. The `proposed` areas of the domestication of African crops lie in a band that extends from Ethiopia across southern Sudan to West Africa. Subsequently, other crops, such as bananas, were introduced from Southeast Asia.
1、非洲早在3千年前有农业，独立发展；2、农业和铁器的传播连接非洲后中心；3、干旱迫使许多人去南边；4、这些人分布在狩猎采集带；5、因为首次培养的作物来自亚洲，所以非洲农业来自近东方；6、非洲人开始发展自己的作物；7、范围广；8、从东南亚引进其他作物。
