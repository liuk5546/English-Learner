#House price
##Dialogue 1
J:How have you been, Mark? Have you settled into your new apartment yet?  
> 你最近怎么样？安顿好你的公寓了吗？

M: Yeah. It's worth paying a little extra rent for something modern.  
> worth doing  
> 值得做某事  
> extra `[ˈekstrə]`  
> rent `[rent]`

J: Have you thought about buying a house?  

M: I've thought about it. But, with the prices so high, I'd rather just keep my money in the bank and invest in stocks.
> invest `[ɪnˈvest]`  
> would 

J: You should have bought a house a few years ago, when they were more within reach.  
> 你本来应该前几年前就买一套房子，当你买的起的时候。
> reach  `[riːtʃ]`  
> rich `[rɪtʃ]`  
> should have done sth. 你本来应该做某事但没有做。  
> within reach  

M: Yeah, don't I know it. I was `too busy` enjoying life then, not thinking about the future.  
> be too busy doing sth.  
> 过度忙于某事

J: Do you think the price will keep going up?  
> 你觉得房价还会继续涨吗？


M: I'm no expert, but I think the growth in sales prices will taper off, as we've been seeing.  
> 我不是专家 = I'm not expert.
> taper off `['teɪpər]`  
> slow down. 慢慢地降低  

J: Do you think there's a `housing bubble`?  
> 房地产泡沫  

M: There might be, with `vacation properties` and `satellite cities`.  
> satellite `['sæt(ə)l.aɪt]` 
> There might be housing bubble with vacation properties and satellite cities.  
> satellite `[ˈsætəlaɪt]`

J: Yeah, `here in major city like Beijing`, people are counting on their houses.  
> count on sth.指望某事  
> 短语 here in major city like Beijing  
> here`[hɪr]` hear`[hɪr]` her`[hər]` hair`[her]`

M: I hear the price are going up in the smaller cities now.  

J: They're still a lot cheaper; but the prices are `climbing` more quickly.  
> the prices climb 价格爬升  

M: Let's hope they don't climb through the roof!  
> climb through the roof  高得离谱
> =increase beyond reason.  
> go/be through the roof  


## Dialogue 2
J: Mark, since you're renting your house, I wonder what you think is going to happen with rental prices.  
> rental prices 租房价格  
> rent 每月交租房的钱  
> what is going to happen? 接下来会发生什么

M: I don't think about it very much.  

J: How do Beijing rental compare with those in the US?  
> A compare with B/ compare A with B  

M: It's easier to find an inexpensive apartment in Beijing. I remember `being up against the wall` in the US before coming to China; but maybe that was because I was just starting work after graduation.  
> up against the wall  
> you have no choice then give up. 窘迫  

J: You mean it's cheaper to rent an apartment in Beijing than in your city in the US?  
> it's cheaper to do sth in sw than in sw  

M: I wouldn't say that. It's just there are so many old buildings and subway lines and small apartments everywhere.  
> 我不是那个意思， 北京有很多老房子，地铁和小公寓。  
> there are so many subway lines in Beijing. You could rent a small apartment out of the city center without considerring that you'll be late for work.  

J: That helps to keep the prices down, I guess.  


M: The cost of owning a house for 70 years, and renting it, `is not all that much different here`.  
> 没有太大得区别

J: Yeah, but people would rather pay for their own house than give money to landlords. Also, according to Chinese tradition, people should have their own house before starting a family.  
> would rather do sth. than do sth.  
> 宁愿。。。也不愿。。。  

M: That's understandable. All the value for owning a house keeps rental prices down a bit.  
> the value for owning a house 拥有房子的重要性  

J: But it seems rental prices are now going up at a faster rate than `purchase prices`.  

M: That doesn't surprise me. `The sky's the limit` when it comes to rental prices.  
> the shy's the limit 一切皆有可能  

J: We'll see what the market will bear.  

M: Mmm, I'm dreaming of a harmonious bull and bear.  
> 有个合理的价格
