#The Origin of the Pacific Island People
The greater Pacific region, traditionally called Oceania, consists 
of three cultural areas: Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. 
Melanesia, in the southwest Pacific, contains the large islands of 
New Guinea, the Solomons, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia. Micronesia, 
the area north of Melanesia, consists primarily of small `scattered` 
islands. Polynesia is the central Pacific area in the great 
triangle `defined` by Hawaii, Easter Island, and New Zealand. 
Before the arrival of Europeans, the islands in the two largest 
cultural areas, Polynesia and Micronesia, together `contained a 
population estimated at 700,000`.

Mel在太平洋西南方，包含新几内亚，Solomons，Vanustu,和New Valedonia这些大岛。
在Mel北边的Mic主要有小而分散的岛屿。Polynesia使太平洋的中心，坐落在由夏威夷，东
岛和新西兰围成的大三角形中。在欧洲人到来之前，那些在P和mic两大文化区中的岛屿一共有
大约700,000人口。

`Speculation` on the origin of these Pacific islanders began as soon 
as outsiders encountered them, in the absence of solid linguistic, 
archaeological, and biological data, many fanciful and mutually 
exclusive theories were `devised`. Pacific islanders are variously 
thought to have come from North America, South America, Egypt, 
Israel, and India, as well as Southeast Asia. Many older theories 
`implicitly` `deprecated` the navigational abilities and overall 
cultural creativity of the Pacific islanders. For example, British 
anthropologists G.Elliot Smith and W.J.Perry assumed that only 
Egyptians would have been skilled enough to navigate and colonize 
the Pacific. They inferred that the Egyptians even crossed the 
Pacific to found the great civilizations of the New World (North and 
South America). In 1947 Norwegian adventurer Thor Heyerdahl drifted 
on a balsa-log raft westward with the winds and currents across the 
Pacific from South America to prove his theory that Pacific islanders 
were Native Americans (also called American Indians). Later Heyerdahl 
suggested that the Pacific was peopled by three migrations: by Native 
Americans from the Pacific Northwest of North America drifting to 
Hawaii, by Peruvians drifting to Easter Island, and by Melanesians. 
In 1969 he crossed the Atlantic in an Egyptian-style reed boat to 
prove Egyptian influences in the Americas. Contrary to these 
theorists, the overwhelming evidence of physical anthropology, 
linguistics, and archaeology shows that the Pacific islanders came 
from Southeast Asia and were skilled enough as navigators to sail 
against the `prevailing` winds and currents.

The basic cultural requirements for the successful colonization of 
the Pacific islands include the appropriate boat-building, sailing, 
and navigation skills to get to the islands `in the first place`, 
domesticated plants and gardening skills suited to often `marginal` 
conditions, and a varied inventory of fishing implements and 
techniques. It is now generally believed that these `prerequisites` 
originated with peoples speaking Austronesian languages (a group 
of several hundred related languages) and began to emerge in 
Southeast Asia by about 5000 B.C.E. The culture of that time, 
based on archaeology and linguistic reconstruction, is assumed to 
have had a broad `inventory` of cultivated plants including taro, 
yarns, banana, sugarcane, breadfruit, coconut, sago, and rice. 
Just as important, the culture also possessed the basic foundation 
for an effective `maritime` adaptation, including outrigger `canoes` 
and a variety of fishing techniques that could be effective for 
overseas voyaging.

Contrary to the arguments of some that much of the pacific was 
settled by Polynesians accidentally `marooned` after being lost and 
`adrift`, it seems reasonable that this `feat` was accomplished by 
deliberate colonization expeditions that set out fully stocked 
with food and domesticated plants and animals. Detailed studies of 
the winds and currents using computer simulations suggest that 
drifting canoes would have been a most unlikely means of colonizing the Pacific. These expeditions were likely driven by population growth and 
political dynamics on the home islands, as well as the challenge 
and excitement of exploring unknown waters.

Because all Polynesians, Micronesians, and many Melanesians speak 
Austronesian languages and grow crops derived from Southeast Asia, 
all these peoples most certainly derived from that region and not 
the New World or elsewhere. The `undisputed` pre-Columbian presence 
in Oceania of the sweet potato, which is a New World domesticate, 
has sometimes been used to support Heyerdahl's "American Indians in 
the Pacific" theories. However, this is one plant out of a long 
list of Southeast Asian domesticates. As Patrick Kirch, an American 
anthropologist, points out, rather than being brought by `rafting` 
South Americans, sweet potatoes might just have easily been brought 
back by returning Polynesian navigators who could have reached the 
west coast of South America.

####P.S.
In 1756 Charles de Brosses theorized that there was an "old black 
race" in the Pacific who were conquered or defeated by the peoples 
of what is now called Polynesia, whom he distinguished as having 
lighter skin.  
old black race 指的就是在Melanesia生活的岛民，这些岛民被Polynesia征服，
Polynesian都是lighter skin的人种。
