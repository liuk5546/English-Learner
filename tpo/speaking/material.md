**真的吗？我坐过这些巴士，有的时候他们只有一些人。确实是一种浪费**

  Really? I’ve ridden those buses, and sometimes there were only a few people on the bus. It did seem like kind of a waste

**我认为问题出在路线太老了，巴士只经过非常昂贵的社区，学生住不起。学校还没有改变路线是非常可笑的。所以巴士现在要去校外住宿学生住的地方。我想如果他们这样做了，会有很多学生坐这些巴士。**

 I think the problem is the route’s out-of-date. It only goes through the neighborhoods that’ve gotten too expensive for students to live in. It’s ridiculous that they haven’t already changed the route—you know, so it goes where most off-campus students live now. I bet if they did that, they’d get plenty of students riding those buses.

**停止校车服务和增加停车位只会鼓励更多的学生在学校里开车。这只会增加学校周围的噪声和交通拥堵。并且这会增加更多的停车位需求**

因为如果他们开始消减（热的早餐）我们就不能在校园里买到，那么我们就会去校园外，以校外价格购买。 你知道吗？这将会是非常昂贵的。即使一周只有两三次，加起来（也很多了）

  cuz if they start cutting back and we can't get what we want right here on campus, well we are going to be going off campus and pay off-campus prices .And you know what? That'll be expensive. Even if it's only two or three mornings a week, it can add up.

是的，并且就开销而言，我认为他们正在走一条弯路。我的意思是，晚课花钱雇佣更多的老师和让教学楼开得更晚，这比简简单单地买更多的计算机贵得多。

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  Right, and as far as expense goes, I think they are going about it the wrong way. I mean, it cost money to hire more teachers and keep the academic building open later, which is a lot more expensive than just simply buying more computers.

你看，这些他们削减的课程都是选修课。必修的课程几乎都是绘画，他们占用了我们大量的时间。我们真正想要的是不同的必修课。然后我们主修学生可以上大量更好的课程，所有的课都是我们喜欢的。

  See, the classes they are eliminating are all optional. The required courses are mostly painting and drawing and they take up all our time. What we really need are different requirements. Then our majors could take a better variety of classes, all the things are interested in.

 但是依旧，他们太极端了。如果钱是一个问题，他们可以雇佣一个兼职教授。又或者，大多数系里面的教师有第二领域。

  But still, they are being drastic. If money is the problem, they could hire a part-time professor, Or, most of the professors in the department have secondary fields.

首先很多学生并不想午餐时间休息。他们边吃饭边学习，特别是考试临近或者他们必须要完成的作业。现在他们不能集中精力。音乐将会非常令人分心。

  Well, first of all, a lot of kids arent `looking for` a relaxing break at lunch time. They like to study while they eat, especially if they have exams coming up or some assignment they have to get done. And now they won't be able to concentrate. This is gonna be very distracting.

The business studies department at State University decide to require all students complete one semester of work experience in a local corporation or a small business.

secure permanent employment.

​								 `[ɪmˈplɔɪmənt]`

获得永久的工作

他们宣传关于领导力和组织能力的提升，但是那不是你认为的那种工作。比如我的哥哥有一份他们讲的工作，你只是在那里做一些基础任务，像打字和将文件归档，一点意义都没有。

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  Well, they talked about leadership and organizational skills, but that’s not really the kind of work you do. Like my elder brothers have the kind of jobs they are talking about and typically you are just there to do basic tasks, like typing or filing stuff, nothing very meaningful.
</details>

问题是许多这个地区的大学有相同的要求，所以很多学生都在一个职务（都有过实习经历）。所以即使当你还是学生的时候在公司有一个这样的职位，一旦你毕业了，永久工作的竞争力将是不可能的。我的意思没有足够的工作给所有这个城市想找全职工作的商科毕业生

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  Well, the problem is that there are lots of other universities in our area that have the same requirement, so there are lots of other students at these positions.So even if you `take a position` like this in a company while you are still a student, once you graduate, the competition for permanent jobs will be impossible. I mean there just won’t be enough jobs available for all the business graduates in the city who will be looking for full time work.

但是那里经常非常拥挤，人群来来往往。不适合展示艺术品。想象你站在那里，尝试欣赏一幅画。将会有百万人走过。人们从你的前面走过，挡住你的视线，打扰你...这么多人走动，你将不能欣赏这幅艺术作品，也无法欣赏任何东西。

  But it’s always really crowded with people coming and going. It’s not good for showing artwork. Imagine you are standing there, trying to look at a painting. There’s gonna be like a million people walking through, people walking in front of you, blocking your view, distracting you… You won’t be able to appreciate the artwork, or get a good look at anything with so much going on, with so many people moving around.

但是这种光都来自窗外的自然光？事实上这样的光不好，因为如果外面是大晴天，光就太亮了。如果是阴天，就太暗了。你想要的是可控的，连续的光源，那种来自电灯泡的光。想象在一个艺术博物馆中，你有点光源，并且光被小心地控制在一样的等级。

  but that kind of light, all that natural light from windows? That’s actually not good because if it’s really sunny out, it’ll be way too bright. If it’s cloudy, it’ll be way too dark.What you want is controlled light, consistent light, the kind you get from electric light bulbs. Think about in an art museum. In an art museum, you’ve got electric lighting, and the light is always carefully controlled, always at the same level.

The university is considering making  major changes to the college radio station. Changes would include an expansion of the station's broadcasting range, which would allow the radio's programming to reach nearby towns. One goal of the plan is to attract more students apply to its communication program. Another goal is to provide the university with an extra source of revenue.University officials expect the enhanced radio station to significantly increase the numebr of listeners, which will in turn encourage businesses to place commercials on the radio.

1. 吸引学生申请communication program
2. 为学校提供额外的收入。

> consider doing sth 考虑做某事
>
> broadcast `[ˈbrɔːdkæst]`播送；广播

> place commercials on the radio. 投放广告

*The university is considering making major changes to the college radio station which would include an expansion of its broadcasting range, because they want to attract more students apply to the communication program and get an extra source of revenue.*



Well, if this proposal goes through, there will be more programs and they would give the students more professional experience as they experiment with programming for a much larger, you know, real-life audience. And **stuff like that** will give them a better shot at getting a job after they graduate.

> proposal [prəˈpoʊzl] [c,u] 提议
>
> give sb a better shot at sth 给某人提供了一个更好的机会
>
> audience [ˈɔːdiəns] 观众

And her second reason is the whole university will benefit from it. Her friend, Tony, told her that the radio station at his university did something like this about five years ago. They are making a lot of money out of commercials and they are using it to offer more scholarships and to help fund projects to renovate the facilities of other programs.

他们从商业广告中赚了一大笔钱，并且使用这些钱提供更多的奖学金，并且帮助建立项目翻新其他项目的设备。

A university official anounced plans to spend $2 million to build a new athletic stadium, commenting that a new stadium would help the university achieve its goal of attracting more top students. Additionally, building a new stadium would allow the university to strengthen the relationship with the town.

> stadium stadia[pl.]

I mean I can't imagine top students being too thrilled about some of the conditions on this campus. Like the science laboratories having such old, outdated equipment, and the library needing more books, and the student center being so small... I think that the two million could be spent in better places if the university is really serious about achieving its goal.

### 14-2

For one thing, if students were permitted to eat, they would be able to concentrate better, because students often get hungry during long classes, and hunger makes it difficult to concentrate. 

首先，如果允许学生吃零食，他们可以更专注，因为学生经常在长时间的课程中感到饥饿，饥饿让注意力难以集中。

Well, like the part about how it would help students concentrate. I mean maybe a little snack will help the person who’s eating it, but the trouble is that it makes it hard for everyone else to concentrate ’cuz they have to listen to someone munching on chips or biting into an apple or crinkling paper wrappers,

> munch on/at sth 大口咀嚼
>
> bit into apple 咬苹果
>
> crinkle paper wrapper 弄皱包装纸

Well, I don’t think it’s appropriate to use class time for that kind of thing. I mean, the last classes are usually pretty important. That’s when we will do a lot reviewing for final exams.

If we use that time for that, we probably wouldn’t have time to do as much reviewing, which means we wouldn’t be as well prepared for exams.
