Now listen to part ot a lecture on this topic in a business management class.

Professor

So let me tell you about my own experience with this when I was working for a computer company a couple of years ago. So one day, **a coworker and I suggested we should give our computers a design makeover**, make them look more up to date. Market research was showing that new customers said they would be more interested in buying our computers if they looked cooler. Our technology was advanced, but the outside design looked really old-fashioned.

> makeover [c,u]外观的改进或改善

At first, **more than half the group supported us**. There were a few **senior managers** there though who **didn't support the design change**. One of the senior managers said, "Our focus has always been on technology. Changing the look is an unnecessary cost." Almost immediately, **some of our supporters changed their minds**. Even my coworker changed his mind. When I asked him why after the meeting, he told me **he didn't want to make a bad impression on the senior managers**. He thought that disagreeing with them might **jeopardize his chances of getting a promotion** by not looking like a team player.

> been `[bɪn]`

What about me? I hate to admit it, but after a few hours of discussion, I started wondering if it was worth everyone's time to argue about this. As more people sided with senior management, **I started to feel like I was the only one holding up the vote. **Everyone else seemed to think change wasn't necessary, so I voted against my own idea in the end. So we unanimously decided to stay with the current old-looking design. But this decision **ended up costing us a lot of money**. That same year, our competitor came out with a new design that attracted some of our customers and prevented us from profiting on potential new customers.
