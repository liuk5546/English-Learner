# The Cambrian Explosion
The geologic timescale is marked by significant geologic and 
biological events, including the origin of Earth about 4.6 
billion years ago, the origin of life about 3.5billion years ago, 
the origin of eukaryotic life-forms (living things that have 
cells with true `nuclei`) about 1.5billion years ago, and the 
origin of animals about 0.6 billion years ago. The last event 
marks the beginning of the Cambrian period. Animals originated 
relatively late in the history of Earth-in only the last 10 
percent of Earth's history. During a geologically brief 
100-million-year period, all modern animal groups (along with other 
animals that are now extinct) evolved. This rapid origin and 
`diversification` of animals is often referred to as "the Cambrian 
explosion."  
显著的地理时标是显著的地理学和生物学的时间标记的，包括大约46亿年前地球诞生，生命诞生于
35亿年前，细胞核生物诞生于15亿年前，动物诞生于6亿年前。动物在地球历史上诞生得比较晚，
仅仅地球史最后的百分之十。在简短的10亿地质年间，所有的动物群进化了。这种动物快速的出现

Scientists have asked important questions about this explosion for more than a century. Why did it occur so late in the history of Earth? The origin of multicellular forms of life seems a relatively simple step compared to the origin of life itself. Why does the fossil record not document the series of evolutionary changes during the evolution of animals? Why did animal life evolve so quickly? Paleontologists continue to search the fossil record for answers to these questions.
&emsp;&emsp;在超过一个世纪以来，科学家问了过于这次大爆发的很多问题。为什么它发生地球史的末期？比起生命起源本身，多核生命的起源貌似是一个相对简单的步骤。为什么化石没有记录动物进化的一系列改变。为什么动物进化得如此快？古生物学家为了回答这些问题，继续研究化石标本。

One interpretation regarding the absence of fossils during this important 100-million-year period is that early animals were soft bodied and simply did not fossilize. Fossilization of soft-bodied animals is less likely than fossilization of hard-bodied animals, but it does occur. Conditions that promote fossilization of soft-bodied animals include very rapid covering by sediments that create an environment that discourages decomposition. In fact, fossil beds containing soft-bodied animals have been known for many years.
一个关于化石在这重要的十亿年消失的解释


The Ediacara fossil formation, which contains the oldest known animal fossils, consists exclusively of soft-bodied forms. Although named after a site in Australia, the Ediacara formation is worldwide in distribution and dates to Precambrian times. This 700-million-year-old formation gives few clues to the origins of modern animals, however, because paleontologists believe it represents an evolutionary experiment that failed. It contains no ancestors of modern animal groups.



A slightly younger fossil formation containing animal remains is the Tommotian formation, named after a locale in Russia. It dates to the very early Cambrian period, and it also contains only soft-bodied forms. At one time, the animals present in these fossil beds were assigned to various modern animal groups, but most paleontologists now agree that all Tommotian fossils represent unique body forms that arose in the early Cambrian period and disappeared before the end of the period, leaving no descendants in modern animal groups.



A third fossil formation containing both soft-bodied and hard-bodied animals provides evidence of the result of the Cambrian explosion. This fossil formation, called the Burgess Shale, is in Yoho National Park in the Canadian Rocky Mountains of British Columbia. Shortly after the Cambrian explosion, mud slides rapidly buried thousands of marine animals under conditions that favored fossilization. These fossil beds provide evidence of about 32 modern animal groups, plus about 20 other animal body forms that are so different from any modern animals that they cannot be assigned to any one of the modern groups. These unassignable animals include a large swimming predator called Anomalocaris and a soft-bodied animal called Wiwaxia, which ate detritus or algae. The Burgess Shale formation also has fossils of many extinct representatives of modern animal groups. For example, a well-known Burgess Shale animal called Sidneyia is a representative of a previously unknown group of arthropods (a category of animals that includes insects, spiders, mites, and crabs).



Fossil formations like the Burgess Shale show that evolution cannot always be thought of as a slow progression. The Cambrian explosion involved rapid evolutionary diversification, followed by the extinction of many unique animals. Why was this evolution so rapid? No one really knows. Many zoologists believe that it was because so many ecological niches were available with virtually no competition from existing species. Will zoologists ever know the evolutionary sequences in the Cambrian explosion? Perhaps another ancient fossil bed of soft-bodied animals from 600-million-year-old seas is awaiting discovery.
