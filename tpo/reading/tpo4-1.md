# Deer Populations of the Puget Sound

## error[9]

 Nearly any kind of plant of the forest `understory` can be part of a deer's diet. Where the forest `inhibits` the growth of grass and other meadow plants, the black-tailed deer browses on huckleberry, salal, dogwood, and almost any other shrub or herb. But this is fair-weather feeding. What keeps the black-tailed deer alive in the harsher seasons of plant decay and dormancy? One `compensation` for not hibernating is the built-in `urge` to migrate. Deer may move from high-elevation browse areas in summer down to the lowland areas in late fall. Even with snow on the ground, the high bushy understory is exposed; also snow and wind bring down `leafy` branches of **cedar, hemlock, red alder, and other arboreal fodder**.  （雪松、铁衫、红桤木和其它乔木）

The numbers of deer have `fluctuated` markedly since the entry of Europeans into Puget Sound country. The early explorers and settlers told of abundant deer in the early 1800s and yet almost in the same breath `bemoaned` the lack of this `succulent` game animal. Famous explorers of the North American frontier, Lewis and Clark had experienced great difficulty finding game west of the Rockies and not until the second of December did they kill their first elk. To keep 40 people alive that winter, they consumed approximately 150 elk and 20 deer. And when game moved out of the lowlands in early spring, the expedition decided to return east rather than face possible starvation. Later on in the early years of the nineteenth century, when Fort Vancouver became the `headquarters` of the Hudson’s Bay Company, deer populations continued to fluctuate. David Douglas, Scottish `botanical` explorer of the 1830s, found a disturbing change in the animal life around the `fort` during the period between his first visit in 1825 and his final contact with the fort in 1832. A recent Douglas biographer states:"The deer which once `picturesquely` `dotted` the meadows around the fort were gone [in 1832], hunted to extermination in order to protect the crops."

 Reduction in numbers of game should have `boded` ill for their survival in later times. A worsening of the plight of deer was to be expected as settlers encroached on the land, logging, burning, and clearing, eventually replacing a wilderness landscape with roads, cities, towns, and factories. No doubt the numbers of deer declined still further. Recall the fate of the Columbian white-tailed deer, now in a protected status. But for the black-tailed deer, human pressure has had just the opposite effect. Wildlife zoologist Hulmut Buechner(1953), in reviewing the nature of biotic changes in Washington through recorded time, says that "since the early 1940s, the state has had more deer than at any other time in its history, the winter population fluctuating around approximately 320,000 deer (mule and black-tailed deer), which will yield about 65,000 of either sex and any age annually for an indefinite period."
