# Planets in Our Solar System

## error[9]

Note: The following text indicates that Pluto is a planet. It was written before the matter of Pluto being defined as a planet became unsettled in the scientific community. The associated questions are `answerable` based on the content in the text.

接下来的文字认为冥王星是行星，在冥王星被定义为行星的事情变得不确定之前写下的文章。相关的问题基于这篇文章可以回答。

The Sun is the `hub` of a huge rotating system consisting of nine planets, their satellites, and numerous small bodies, including asteroids, comets, and `meteoroids`. An estimated 99.85 percent of the mass of our solar system is contained within the Sun, while the planets `collectively` make up most of the remaining 0.15 percent. The planets, in order of their distance from the Sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. Under the control of the Sun's gravitational force, each planet maintains an `elliptical orbit` and all of them travel in the same direction.

1、太阳是一个大型旋转系统的中心，包含九大行星，他们的卫星，无数的小型天体，包括小行星，彗星，和流星体。2、估计的99.85%的太阳系质量被包括在太阳中，而行星总共构成了剩下大多数的0.15%；3、根据行星与太阳的距离排列，他们是水星，金星，地球，火星，木星，土星，天王星，海王星和冥王星。4、在太阳的引力控制下，每一个行星保持一个椭圆的轨道，他们所有都运行在同样的方向上。

The planets in our solar system fall into two groups: the terrestrial (Earth-like) planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) and the Jovian (Jupiter-like) planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). Pluto is not included in either category, because its great distance from Earth and its small size make this planet's true nature a mystery.The most obvious difference between the terrestrial and the Jovian planets is their size. The largest terrestrial planet, Earth has a diameter only one quarter as great as the diameter of the smallest Jovian planet, Neptune, and its mass is only one seventeenth as great. Hence, the Jovian planets are often called giants. Also, because of their relative locations, the four Jovian planets are known as the outer planets, while the terrestrial planets are known as the inner planets. There appears to be a correlation between the positions of these planets and their sizes.

1、行星在我们的太阳系中分为两大类：类地行星和类木行星。2、冥王星哪个都不是。3、类地行星和类木行星最大的不同就是大小。4、最大的类地行星，地球直径只有最小的类木行星直径的四分之一，质量只有七分之一。5、所以，类木行星叫做巨行星。6、并且，因为他们的相关的位置，四个类木行星被公认为外行星，而类地行星被公认为内行星。7、这里明显有一个位置和大小的关联。

Other dimensions along which the two groups differ markedly are density and composition. The densities of the terrestrial planets average about 5 times the density of water, whereas the Jovian planets have densities that average only 1.5 times the density of water. One of the outer planets, Saturn, has a density of only 0.7 that of water, which means that Saturn would float in water. Variations in the composition of the planets `are largely responsible for` the density differences. The substances that make up both groups of planets are divided into three groups-gases, rocks, and ices-based on their melting points. The terrestrial planets are mostly rocks: dense rocky and metallic material, with minor amounts of gases. The Jovian planets, on the other hand, contain a large percentage of the gases hydrogen and helium, with varying amounts of ices: mostly water, ammonia, and methane ices.

因为成分不一样，所以密度不一样

3s：密度和组成不一样

> be responsible for sth 作为。。。的原因

The Jovian planets have very thick atmospheres consisting of varying amounts of hydrogen, helium, methane, and ammonia. By comparison, the terrestrial planets have meager atmospheres at best. A planet's ability to retain an atmosphere depends on its temperature and mass. `Simply stated`, a gas molecule can "evaporate" from a planet if it reaches a speed known as the escape velocity. For Earth, this velocity is 11 kilometers per second. Any material, including a rocket, must reach this speed before it can leave Earth and go into space. The Jovian planets, because of their greater masses and thus higher surface gravities, have higher escape velocities (21-60 kilometers per second) than the terrestrial planets. Consequently, it is more difficult for gases to "evaporate" from them. Also, because the molecular motion of a gas depends on temperature, at the low temperatures of the Jovian planets even the lightest gases are unlikely to acquire the speed needed to escape. On the other hand, a comparatively warm body with a small surface gravity, like Earth's moon, is unable to hold even the heaviest gas and thus lacks an atmosphere. The slightly larger terrestrial planets Earth, Venus, and Mars retain some heavy gases like carbon dioxide, but even their atmospheres make up only an `infinitesimally` small portion of their total mass.

类木行星大气层非常厚，有大量的氢，氦，甲烷和氨气。比较起来，地球充其量有稀薄的大气。行星留住大气的能力取决于他的温度和质量。简单的说，气体原子会挥发，如果它快到逃逸速度。类木行星，质量大-》地表引力大-〉逃逸速度大-》气体难以蒸发。温度决定气体动能，温度低-〉难到达逃逸速度。

The orderly nature of our solar system leads most astronomers to conclude that the planets formed at essentially the same time and from the same material as the Sun. **It is hypothesized that the `primordial` cloud of dust and gas from which all the planets are thought to have condensed had a composition somewhat similar to that of Jupiter. **However, unlike Jupiter, the terrestrial planets today are nearly void of light gases and ices. The explanation may be that the terrestrial planets were once much larger and richer in these materials but eventually lost them because of these bodies' relative closeness to the Sun, which meant that their temperatures were relatively high.

类木行星：厚重的大气层。保留大气层的能力取决于温度和质量。到达逃逸速度，气体粒子“蒸发”。类木行星质量大重力大，有更高的逃逸速度。所以气体难以“蒸发”。气体原子动能取决于温度，低温下很轻的气体也不可能获得逃逸速度。类地行星大气只占总质量很小一部分。

行星和太阳同一时间形成。原始星云成分和木星类似。类地行星没有轻的气体和冰。原来有，后来失去了，因为距离太阳近，温度高。

太阳系有序的特征导致大多数天文学家认为，行星在同一时间形成，形成时和太阳有同样的物质。假设原始的尘埃气体星云有与木星相类似的成分。
