Hi, I am a first year student here. I live in dorms and I like where I'm living now, it's convenient and quiet. But I am starting to think where I want to live next year.  
Good idea. As a second year student, you'll have more freedom to choose a place that suits your needs.  
是的，作为一个二年级学生，你有自由选择一个迎合你需求的地方住。

I want to make sure that I apply in time to get what I want. A friend was telling me common intrest houses in our campus.  
Science house, music house, and language house.  
I am not music major, but I play music like `instrument`. I am a history major.

That's not a issue. You see, that house isn't just for music majors. It's for everyone who's interested in music.  
Isn't that everyone?  
音乐宿舍对所有喜欢音乐的人建造的。 那不就是所有人了。

The house has  a performance area and practice rooms, so people who choose to live there need to be open to the possibility that there's always going to be someone playing something-an instrument, the radio... even at odd times.

Well, it does sound like it `might be a good fit for` you. And the house also functions as a social club.  
> sth. be a good fit for sb. 某物适合某人。  
> function as  
> 起。。。作用；具有。。。功能。  
> The sofa also functions as a bed.
