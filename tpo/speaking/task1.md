### 1. Some people believe that television has had a positive influence on society. Others believe it has had a negative influence on society. Which do you agree with and why? Use details and examples to explain your opinion.
My Anwser:  
&emsp;&emsp;I think television has had a positive `influence` on society. Because it's a good way to get information before the computer was born. For example, I still `remember` when I was young I didn't have a personal computer. At that time, the only way I can get science knowledge was an education TV program on Saturday night. And you know because of that program, I decided to major in Computer Science in College I guess. And There were a lot of people like me who were stronly influenced by tv series and then make their career decision at that age in China.  

Referrence:  
&emsp;&emsp;Television, which is often termed as the ‘idiot box’ by many, is one of the most important electronic media devices today. Almost every house today owns a television set and it has surely become one of the most important parts of our lives. Earlier, it used to be only a means of entertainment because of the movies, music and shows that are `put up` with `an intention of` entertaining the viewers. But more than just entertaining, televisions have `come a long way in` benefiting its viewers and audience.  

> have come a long way in doing sth.  
> 做某事已经很长时间了  
> Televisions have come a long way in benefiting its viewers and audience.  
> 电视机已经有利于它的观众和观看者很久了。

> vt. 有利于（sb）
> vi. 得益于 （from/by sth）

&emsp;&emsp;Televisions are `no more` source of just movies and music. There are a number of new channels that keep us acquainted with the world. News is displayed 24×7 from all parts of the world which is helpful for us as we can get access to that just through our television. Apart from this, many cable operators offer online study lessons, dance lessons, yoga, exercise, cooking etc. Television can be put to a great use in this manner as it can be used to study and learn other useful activities as well.

&emsp;&emsp;However, it is `adamant` that television must be used and watched in a limited amount only. Excess `exposure` to television can have serious impacts on eyes and brain of a person. It is important to understand where and when to stop.

**A medium of educational advancement**  
We have entered an age of technology. Everything is going digital and technical. Education is now not just limited to books and paperbacks. Digital means of education provide a better visualization for a student. Television doesn’t `fall short in` contributing to the same. There are many channels on television which are contributed to covering `syllabus` topics for certain subjects. Others like the discovery channel brings out brand new inventions and knowledge stuff which is great for children as well as the adults.

An excellent source of Entertainment
This fact is so obvious that it can never be denied. Television is one of the major sources of entertainment since the day of its invention. There are so many things that the TV encompasses. There are movies, music channels, cartoons and every other kind of dance/music shows. Apart from this, news channels also do contain much entertaining stuff every now and then.

Sports
TV is the best source to know what sports activities are going on in the world. They can be read in the newspaper too, sure. But the actual games that are broadcasted over the television can be clearly witnessed by the people around the world. Not only do they become aware about the techniques of the sports, but they can witness the whole game and learn many more important things about that sport.

Informational stuff on cultures around the world
TV today has an endless range of stuff. From cookery shows to travel diaries, the TV today can sport just almost anything. Such shows acquaint us with the world outside us and our country. We are introduced with the outer world and their culture. This effectively adds to our knowledge of the world and help us in appreciating the beauty of different cultures around the world.

As a source of inspiration
A number of TV shows and documentaries that are put up over the television can have a number of positive effects on the children as well as the youth today. Watching people succeeding in their lives and some inspirational movies, their morale can be boosted and it can therefore work as a great source of inspiration for the young generation.  

### 2.Some college students choose to take courses in a variety of subject areas in order to get a broad education. Others choose to focus on a single subject area in order to have a deeper understanding of that area. Which approach to course selection do you think is better for students and why?
Focusing on a single subject area is better for students. Because some courses may be useless to their future. I still remember when I was in high school, I had to learn math, science, and history and stuff like that. But you know I hate history coz I don't like remember timelines of historical events. I still had to cost lots of time on it which had a bad effect on the other subjects I like. As a result, I always couldn't get decent scores in every subject. In short, I disagree that students should take courses in a variety of subject areas. 

### 3.Some students prefer to work on class assignments by themselves. Others believe it is better to work in a group. Which do you prefer? Explain why.
I prefer to work on class assignments by myself coz I can focus attention on them. For example, when I was in college, there was a time my professor gave us a very tough assignment. Some classmates just like me didn't know how to finish it, so we decide to discuss it in the dorm. At first, everything's fine. But later, we started to talk about something not related to our work. At last, we didn't finish the assignment and got very bad grades. I think if I work on by myself, the end will be different.

> give `/ɡɪv/` gave `/ɡeɪv/` given `/ˈɡɪvn/`
> tough `/tʌf/`

I don't think all children should be required to learn a second language in school. Children are more interested in playing basketball, football and other sports. Even if they are required to learn a second language, they won't treat it seriously. I had many friends in junior high who didn't learn language at all. But they could play basketball very well and maybe some of them can become professional players. There is no need to learn a second language. Also, many of the children won't have the chance to use the second language because when they grow up, their job may not need any foreign language skills. For example, many of my high school classmates now work as clerks in banks and they don't need foreign language in their work. Still, they can do just fine.

### 4. Some university graduate choose to spend a period of time doing volunteer or community service before their careers. Others think it is better to start working as soon as possible after graduation. Which view do you agree with?

I think it's better to start working because attending university cost a huge sum of money. Take me as a example. When I got into college, I almost spent 40 thousands dollars for my tuition each year. My family have been a heavy burden in finance for the past 4 years. So, when graduated, I decide to hunter for a job to earn the money back and even to make a killing. As for another option, I just don't like volunteer service because volunteer organzations never pay for our services and always waste our time to do something in vain.
