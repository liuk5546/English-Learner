**Ok, we have been talking about how throughout history, it was often difficult for people to give up ideas which have long been taken for granted as scientific truth, even if those ideas were false.**In Astronomy, for example, the `distinction` between the solar system and the universe wasn’t clear until modern times. 
The ancient Greeks believed that what we called the solar system was in fact the entire universe, and that the universe was geocentric.Geocentric means Earth-centered, so the geocentric view holds that the Sun, the planets, and the stars, all revolve around the Earth, which is stationary.Of course, we now know that the planets, including Earth, `revolve` around the Sun, and that the solar system is only a tiny part of the universe.

我们上节课已经讨论了，纵观历史，对于人们放弃长时间被认为是科学真理的事情是多么得困难。太阳系和宇宙的区别不是很清楚。认为太阳系就是宇宙，宇宙是以地球为中心的。
