**Ok, we have been talking about how throughout history, it was often difficult for people to give up ideas which have long been taken for granted as scientific truth, even if those ideas were false.**In Astronomy, for example, the `distinction` between the solar system and the universe wasn’t clear until modern times. 
The ancient Greeks believed that what we called the solar system was in fact the entire universe, and that the universe was geocentric.Geocentric means Earth-centered, so the geocentric view holds that the Sun, the planets, and the stars, all revolve around the Earth, which is stationary.Of course, we now know that the planets, including Earth, `revolve` around the Sun, and that the solar system is only a tiny part of the universe.

我们上节课已经讨论了，纵观历史，对于人们放弃长时间被认为是科学真理的事情是多么得困难。太阳系和宇宙的区别不是很清楚。认为太阳系就是宇宙，宇宙是以地球为中心的。

So, why did the ancient Greeks believe that the Earth was the center of the universe?Well, it made sense to them.Observations of the sky make it appear as if the Sun, the moon, and the stars all revolve around the Earth every day, while the Earth itself stayed in one place. 
And this view is also supported by their philosophical and religious beliefs about the origin and structure of the universe.It was presented in the works of well-known Greek philosophers as early as the fourth century B.C.E., and the geocentric theory continue to `prevail` in Western thought for almost 2,000 years, until the 17th century.

Now, what’s especially interesting is that when astronomical observations were made that seemed to be inconsistent with the geocentric view, the ancient Greeks did not really consider alternative theories. *It was so intuitive, so sensible that the Earth was the center of the universe* that astronomers found ways to explain those seemingly inconsistent phenomena within the geocentric view.

地球是中心非常合理。the geocentric itself was not considered questionable.地形说本身没有太大的问题。

> sensible 明智的，合理的

For example, Greek astronomers made excellent, very accurate observations of the movements of the planets, but the observations revealed a bit of a problem.The geocentric theory said, that the planets would move around the Earth in one direction.However, astronomers noticed that at times, several planets seem to stop moving in one direction and start moving backward in their orbits around the Earth, and they came up with a theory that these planets themselves moved in smaller circles called epicycles as they travelled around the Earth.

希腊天文学家做了很好很精确的天体移动观察，但是这些观察揭示了一个问题。地心说认为，这些天体绕着地球沿一个方向转。但是天文学家发现有些时候一些天体似乎停止向一个方向运动，转而开始反方向运动。他们想出一个理论这些天体沿着一个叫epicycle的圈转，同时他们又绕着地球转。

Here’s a picture of what they imagined.You see how this epicycle theory could account for the seemingly backward motion of the planet.Of course, today we know that this appearance of backward motion is caused by the fact that Earth, as well as other planets, all move in their own orbits around the Sun, and the relative movements of the planets with respect to each other can get quite complex.
