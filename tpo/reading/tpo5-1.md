Research has shown that certain `minerals` are required by plants
for normal growth and development. The soil is the source of
these minerals, which are absorbed by the plant with the water
from the soil. Even `nitrogen`, which is a gas in its `elemental
state`, is normally absorbed from the soil as `nitrate ions`.
Some soils are notoriously `deficient` in micro nutrients and
are therefore unable to support most plant life. So-called
`serpentine` soils, for example, are deficient in calcium, and
only plants able to tolerate low levels of this mineral can
survive. In modern agriculture, mineral `depletion` of soils
is a `major concern`, since harvesting crops interrupts the
recycling of nutrients back to the soil.  
研究已经表明植物的正常生长和发展需要特定的矿物质。土壤是这些矿物质的来源，植物
通过水从土壤中吸收矿物质。甚至，基本状态为气态的氮气也作为硝酸盐离子被从土壤中
吸收。众所周知，一些土壤缺乏微量的营养物质，因此不能养活大多数的植物。所谓的
serpentine soil 缺少钙，并且仅有能耐受低钙的植物可以生存。在现代农业，
因为收获农作物阻碍了营养物质回到土壤中，所以土壤中矿物质的枯竭是一件大事。

Mineral deficiencies can often be detected by specific symptoms 
such as chlorosis (loss of chlorophyll resulting in yellow or 
white leaf tissue), necrosis (isolated dead patches), anthocyanin 
formation (development of deep red pigmentation of leaves or 
stem), `stunted` growth, and development of woody tissue in an 
`herbaceous` plant. Soils are most commonly deficient in nitrogen 
and `phosphorus`. Nitrogen-deficient plants exhibit many of the 
symptoms just described. Leaves develop chlorosis; stems are 
short and `slender`, and `anthocyanin` discoloration occurs on stems, 
petioles, and lower leaf surfaces. Phosphorus-deficient plants 
are often stunted, with leaves turning a characteristic dark 
green, often with the accumulation of anthocyanin. Typically, 
older leaves are affected first as the phosphorus is mobilized 
to young growing tissue. Iron deficiency is characterized by 
chlorosis between veins in young leaves.
特定的症状可以发现矿物质缺乏，比如chlorsis，necrosis，anthocyanin formation，
stunted growth和草本植物的木质组织生长（如褪绿（叶绿素损失导致黄叶或白叶的现象）、
坏疽（孤立的坏死斑）、花青素的形成（形成深红色叶片和茎色素沉积）、发育不良以及草本植物长木质组织。）。
土壤最常缺少的就是氮和磷。缺氮植物会展现许多才提到的症状。。。。缺磷的植物会怎么怎么样。
典型地，老叶子会首先被影响，因为钾肥会向年轻的叶子移动。缺铁会表现为叶茎缺绿症。

Much of the research on nutrient deficiencies is based on growing 
plants hydroponically, that is, in soilless liquid nutrient solutions.
 This technique allows researchers to create solutions that selectively 
 omit certain nutrients and then observe the `resulting effects` on 
the plants. Hydroponics has applications beyond basic research, 
since it `facilitates` the growing of greenhouse vegetables during 
winter. Aeroponics, a technique in which plants are suspended and 
the roots `misted` with a nutrient solution, is another method for 
growing plants without soil.
许多营养缺失研究基于水培植物，这是无土水培解决方案。这项科技使得研究者可以创造各种解决方案，
这些解决方案有选择地省略特定营养物质，从而使得研究人员随后可以观察对这些植物的影响结果。
水培植物的应用远不止基础研究，因为它使在冬天种植温室蔬菜成为可能。气培种植是另一种无土
种植植物的方法，用这种科技，植物悬在半空，他的根用营养液湿润。

While mineral deficiencies can limit the growth of plants, an 
overabundance of certain minerals can be toxic and can also limit 
growth. Saline soils, which have high concentrations of `sodium 
chloride` and other salts, limit plant growth, and research continues 
to focus on developing salt-tolerant varieties of agricultural crops. 
Research has focused on the toxic effects of heavy metals such as 
lead, cadmium, mercury, and aluminum; however, even copper and zinc
, which are essential elements, can become toxic in high `concentrations`. 
Although most plants cannot survive in these soils, certain plants 
have the ability to tolerate high levels of these minerals.
虽然矿物质缺失会阻碍植物生长，但是某些矿物质过多是有毒的且也会阻碍植物生长。含有高浓度的

大多数的植物不能在以上这些土壤中存活，一些特定的植物可以耐受高水平的矿物质含量。

Scientists have known for some time that certain plants, called 
hyperaccumulators, can concentrate minerals at levels `a hundredfold 
or greater` than normal. A survey of known hyperaccumulators 
identified that 75 percent of them amassed nickel; [cobalt, copper, 
zinc, manganese, lead, and cadmium are other minerals of choice.] 
Hyperaccumulators run the entire range of the plant world. 
They may be herbs, shrubs, or trees. Many members of the `mustard` 
family, `spurge family`, legume family, and grass family are top 
hyperaccumulators. Many are found in tropical and subtropical 
areas of the world, where accumulation of high concentrations of 
metals may `afford` some protection against plant-eating insects and 
microbial pathogens.  
科学家已经知道有一段时间了，某些植物可以聚集大于正常植物百倍或更多的矿物质.一则关
于著名hyperaccumulators的调查指出75%的h积累镍；其他25%的H选择其他的金属吸收。
H可能是草本植物，灌木或者树。许多H生长在热带和亚热带地区，收集高浓度的金属可能提供某些保护
用于对抗食草虫子和微生物病原体。

Only recently have investigators considered using these plants to 
clean up soil and waste sites that have been `contaminated` by toxic
levels of heavy metals–an environmentally friendly approach known 
as phytoremediation. This scenario begins with the planting of 
hyperaccumulating species in the target area, such as an abandoned 
mine or an irrigation pond contaminated by runoff. Toxic minerals 
would first be absorbed by roots but later relocated to the stem 
and leaves. A `harvest` of the `shoots` would remove the toxic compounds 
off site to be burned or `composted` to recover the metal for 
industrial uses. After several years of cultivation and harvest, 
the site would be restored at a cost much lower than the price of 
excavation and reburial, the standard practice for `remediation` of 
contaminated soils. For examples, in field trials, the plant alpine
 pennycress removed zinc and cadmium from soils near a zinc smelter, 
and Indian mustard, native to Pakistan and India, has been 
effective in reducing levels of `selenium` salts by 50 percent in 
contaminated soils.  
最近研究人员考虑到使用这些植物来清洁土壤和因有毒等级的重金属污染而废弃的地方--一个环境
友好的方法被称为phytoremediation。这一场景在目标地区，比如废弃的矿场或者被地表径
流污染的灌溉池，开始种植H类的植物。有毒的矿物质首先被根吸收，之后运送到茎叶当中去。
幼苗的收获将有毒的化合物从这个地方烧掉或者堆积还原成金属供工厂使用。在多年的培育和
收获后，这个地方将会以比清空和填埋更低的价格重建。举个例子，在土地实验中，植物
`alpine pennycress`在冶锌厂附近从土壤中消除锌和钙。印度mustard有效消除土壤中
50%的晒盐。

从种植地移除有毒化合物。新芽被烧毁或堆肥最后还原成金属供工业使用。
