# Urban Climate

## error[5，7，8]

The city is an extraordinary `processor` of mass and energy and has its own `metabolism`. A daily input of water, food, and energy of various kinds is matched by an output of `sewage`, solid waste, air pollutants, energy, and materials that have been transformed in some way. The quantities involved are enormous. Many aspects of this energy use affect the atmosphere of a city, particularly in the production of heat.

In winter the heat produced by a city can equal or surpass the amount of heat available from the Sun. All the heat that warms a building eventually transfers to the surrounding air, a process that is quickest where houses are poorly insulated. But an automobile produces enough heat to warm an average house in winter; and if a house were perfectly insulated, one adult could also produce more than enough heat to warm it. Therefore, even without any industrial production of heat, an urban area tends to be warmer than the countryside that surrounds it.

在冬天，城市产生的热量可以等于甚至超过从太阳获得的热量。所有的热量传送到周围的空气中，传送过程当房屋密封性很差时是最快的。但是，如果房子密封性好，一个成年人可以产生足够的能量温暖房子。因此，即使是没有工厂产生热量，城市地区也比乡村地区更热。



The burning of fuel, such as by cars, is not the only source of this increased heat. Two other factors contribute to the higher overall temperature in cities. The first is the heat capacity of the materials that constitute the city, which is typically dominated by `concrete` and `asphalt`. During the day, heat from the Sun can be `conducted` into these materials and stored-to be released at night. But in the countryside materials have a significantly lower heat capacity because a vegetative blanket prevents heat from easily flowing into and out of the ground.

The second factor is that radiant heat coming into the city from the Sun is trapped in two ways: (1) by a continuing series of reflections among the numerous `vertical` surfaces that buildings present and (2) by the dust `dome`, the cloudlike layer of polluted air that most cities produce. Shortwave radiation from the Sun passes through the pollution dome more easily than outgoing longwave radiation does; the latter is absorbed by the `gaseous ` `pollutants` of the dome and reradiated back to the urban surface.

第二个因素是，从太阳来的辐射热量以两种方式被吸收。在许多垂直表面中，一系列连续的反射（吸收了太阳辐射热），灰尘穹顶（吸收了太阳辐射热）。短波辐射比长波辐射更容易穿过穹顶；长波辐射被气体污染物吸收。

Cities, then, are warmer than the surrounding rural areas, and together they produce a phenomenon known as the urban heat island. Heat islands develop best under particular conditions associated with light winds, but they can form almost any time. The `precise` **"configuration"** of a heat island depends on several factors. For example, the wind can make a heat island `stretch` in the direction it blows. **When a heat island is well developed, variations can be extreme; **in winter, busy streets in cities can be 1.7°C warmer than the side streets. Areas near traffic lights can be similarly warmer than the areas between them because of the effect of cars standing in traffic instead of moving. The maximum differences in temperature between neighboring urban and rural environments is called the heat-island `intensity` for that region. In general, the larger the city, the greater its heat-island intensity. The actual level of intensity depends on such factors as the physical layout, population density, and productive activities of a metropolis.

The surface-atmosphere relationships inside metropolitan areas produce a number of climatic `peculiarities`. For one thing, the presence or absence of moisture is affected by the special `qualities` of the urban surface. **With much of the built-up landscape `impenetrable` by water, even gentle rain runs off almost immediately from rooftops, streets, and parking lots. **Thus, city surfaces, as well as the air above them, tend to be drier between episodes of rain; with little water available for the cooling process of evaporation, relative humidities are usually lower. Wind movements are also modified in cities because buildings increase the `friction` on air flowing around them. This friction tends to slow the speed of winds, making them far less efficient at `dispersing` pollutants. On the other hand, air turbulence increases because of the effect of skyscrapers on airflow. Rainfall is also increased in cities. **The cause appears to be in part greater turbulence in the urban atmosphere as hot air rises from the built-up surface.**

在城市地区的地表-大气关系产生许多气候现象。一件事就是水汽的出现与消失受城市地标的特殊特征影响。城市地面雨季是干的。相对湿度低。建筑增加了空气流过他们的摩擦力-》风的移动变慢了-〉风清除污染的效率降低。但是，高建筑对气流有影响，空气乱流增加。造成这一现象的部分原因看似是在城市大气中更大的乱流？？？
