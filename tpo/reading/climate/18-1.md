# Lightning

## error[10,14]

Lightning is a brilliant flash of light produced by an electrical discharge from a storm cloud. The electrical discharge takes place when `the attractive tension` between a region of negatively charged particles and a region of positively charged particles becomes so great that the charged particles suddenly rush together. The coming together of the oppositely charged particles `neutralizes` the electrical tension and releases a tremendous amount of energy, which we see as lightning. The `separation` of positively and negatively charged particles takes place during the development of the storm cloud.

The separation of charged particles that forms in a storm cloud has a sandwich-like structure. Concentrations of positively charged particles develop at the top and bottom of the cloud, but the middle region becomes negatively charged. Recent measurements made in the field together with laboratory simulations offer a promising explanation of how this structure of charged particles forms. What happens is that small (millimeter- to centimeter-size) `pellets` of ice form in the cold upper regions of the cloud. When these ice pellets fall, some of them strike much smaller ice crystals in the center of the cloud. The temperature at the center of the cloud is about -15?C or lower. At such temperatures, the collision between the ice pellets and the ice crystals causes `electrical charges` to shift so that the ice pellets acquire a negative charge and the ice crystals become positively charged. Then `updraft` wind currents carry the light, positively charged ice crystals up to the top of the cloud. The heavier, negatively charged ice pellets are left to concentrate in the center. This process explains why the top of the cloud becomes positively charged, while the center becomes negatively charged. The negatively charged region is large: several hundred meters thick and several kilometers in diameter. Below this large, cold, negatively charged region, the cloud is warmer than -15?C, and at these temperatures, collisions between ice crystals and falling ice pellets produce positively charged ice pellets that then populate a small region at the base of the cloud.

Most lightning takes place within a cloud when the charge separation within the cloud collapses. However, as the storm cloud develops, the ground beneath the cloud becomes positively charged and lightning can take place in the form of an electrical discharge between the negative charge of the cloud and the positively charged ground. Lightning that strikes the ground is the most likely to be destructive, so even though it represents only 20 percent of all lightning, it has received a lot of scientific attention.

大多数闪电在云层中发生。云中的负电荷和地上的正电荷也会产生闪电。因为击打地面的闪电最具破坏性，所以最受科学关注

Using high-speed photography, scientists have determined that there are two steps to the occurrence of lightning from a cloud to the ground. First, a channel, or path, is formed that connects the cloud and the ground. Then a strong current of electrons follows that path from the cloud to the ground, and it is that current that illuminates the channel as the lightning we see.

使用高速摄影，科学家确定云层和地面间的闪电出现有两步。首先，连接云层和地面的路径形成。然后，一股强大的电子流沿着这个路径从云层通向地面，这个照亮通道的电流就是我们看到的闪电。

The formation of the channel is initiated when electrons surge from the cloud base toward the ground. When a stream of these negatively charged electrons comes within 100 meters of the ground, it is met by a stream of positively charged particles that comes up from the ground. When the negatively and positively charged streams meet, a complete channel connecting the cloud and the ground is formed. The channel is only a few centimeters in diameter, but that is wide enough for electrons to follow the channel to the ground in the visible form of a flash of lightning. The stream of positive particles that meets the surge of electrons from the cloud often arises from a tall, pointed structure such as a metal flagpole or a tower. That is why the subsequent lightning that follows the completed channel often strikes a tall structure.

当电子激增，通道的形成就开始了。负电荷电子流与地面的正电荷粒子流相遇，完整的通道就形成了。通道直径只有几厘米，但足够宽。正电荷粒子流经常从高而尖的建筑中出现。这就是为什么之后到来的闪电经常雷击高的建筑。

Once a channel has been formed, it is usually used by several lightning discharges, each of them consisting of a stream of electrons from the cloud meeting a stream of positive particles along the established path. Sometimes, however, a stream of electrons following an established channel is met by a positive stream making a new path up from the ground. The result is a forked lightning that strikes the ground in two places.

一旦通道形成，通道会被多次闪电放电使用，每一次放电包含来自云层的电子流与正粒子流相遇，沿着已经建立的通道。然而有的时候，正电荷流建立了一条从地面来的新路径，与沿着原来路径的负电子流相遇。结果就是一个锯齿形闪电雷击地面上的两个地方。
