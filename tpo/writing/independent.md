1\. distracted, addicted to video games.

2\. have negative effects on physical health

3\. 让步 Some people may support that children have the freedom to use computers. This is because that being familar with operation of these advanced devices will help children hunting for a better job in the futrue. However, I disagree with this point. To be more specific, children could learn how to take advantage of computer until they start to work. The goals at young ages are learn knowledge from school teachers.

### 思路练习

#### 一、
1. cost
2. motivation/interest
3. effectiveness

From my perspective, the distance to my relatives is the most important factor when I choose a place to live.  
To begin with, a less expensive location is always  not convenient in the aspects of transportation and shopping.  
Moreover, if a locale is near many shops and restaurants, the dwellers will be disturbed by the noise for all day.  
However, close relatives can give me a favor immediately when I am indeed.  
To conclude, compared with the two options, whether I live close to  relatives or not is my first consideration when I buy or rent  an apartment.  

#### 二、

Which one is the most important for high school teachers? (students aged 15 to 18)  
A. The ability to give advice about planning for future.  
B. The ability to recognize students that need help.  
C. The ability to encourage students to learn on their own outside the classroom.

From my perspective, the ability to ecourage students to learn on their own outside the classroom.

To begin with, students in high school have the right to plan for future on their own.

Moreover, if students need help, they will tell their teachers. The ability to recognize students in trouble is usless for a teacher.

However, students will learn and research by themselves one day, so teaching them how to study on their own benefit their future.
