# Climate of Venus

## error[13]

### p1

Earth has abundant water in its oceans but very little carbon dioxide in its relatively thin atmosphere.   

地球水多，CO2少。

By contrast, Venus is very dry and its thick atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide.

金星水少，CO2多

The original atmospheres of both Venus and Earth were derived at least in part from gases spewed forth, or `outgassed`, by volcanoes. 

两颗行星的原始大气至少一部分来自火山喷出或除气获得的气体。

The gases that `emanate` from present-day volcanoes on Earth, such as Mount Saint Helens, are predominantly water vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide.  
在地球上，如今火山产生的气体主要是水蒸汽，二氧化碳和二氧化硫。

> emanate vt 产生；表现

These gases should therefore have been important parts of the original atmospheres of both Venus and Earth.  
这些气体本应该是地球和金星元素大气很重要的组成部分。

Much of the water on both planets is also thought to have come from impacts from comets, icy bodies formed in the outer solar system.  
两个星球的许多水也被认为来自彗星撞击，形成于外太阳系的冰体。

summary: 金星原来有水，co2，so3，现在水没了。  

### p2

In fact, water probably once dominated the Venusian atmosphere. 

金星大气可能曾经大部分是水。

Venus and Earth are similar in size and mass, so Venusian volcanoes may well have outgassed as much water vapor as on Earth, and both planets would have had about the same number of comets strike their surfaces. 

金星和地球大小和质量相似，所以金星火山和地球排出相同的水蒸气。并且两个星球有差不多的彗星撞击。

>strike-struck-struck,stricken 撞击 [straɪk]
>
>[sing.] 击，打；踢

Studies of how stars evolve suggest that the early Sun was only about 70 percent as `luminous` as it is now, so the temperature in Venus' early atmosphere must have been quite a bit lower. 

早期太阳只有现在的70%亮，所以早起金星大气温度一定低一点。

> luminous adj. 鲜亮的

Thus water vapor would have been able to `liquefy` and form oceans on Venus. 

所以水蒸汽可以在金星上液化和形成大海

> liquefy vt,vi 液化

But if water vapor and carbon dioxide were once so common in the atmospheres of both Earth and Venus, what became of Earth's carbon dioxide? And what happened to the water on Venus?

地球上的CO2结果怎么样了？金星上的水发生了什么？

### p3

The answer to the first question is that carbon dioxide is still found in abundance on Earth, but now, instead of being in the form of atmospheric carbon dioxide, it is either dissolved in the oceans or chemically bound into carbonate rocks, such as the limestone and marble that formed in the oceans.  

co2在地球上还是很多。不是溶解在海里就是与石灰盐岩化学结合。

> either ... or ... 不是，就是
>
> bind - bound - bound vt.结合

If Earth became as hot as Venus, much of its carbon dioxide would **be boiled out of the oceans and baked out of the crust**. 

如果地球变得和金星一样热，许多二氧化碳将会从海洋中沸腾并且从地壳中烘烤出来。

Our planet would soon develop a thick, oppressive carbon dioxide atmosphere much like that of Venus.

地球将会很快有一个厚重的，令人窒息的大气层。

> oppressive  令人窒息的

### p4

To answer the question about Venus' lack of water, we must return to the early history of the planet. Just as on present-day Earth, the oceans of Venus limited the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide by dissolving it in the oceans and binding it up in carbonate rocks. 

和现在的地球一样

But being closer to the Sun than Earth is, enough of the liquid water on Venus would have vaporized to create a thick cover of water vapor cIouds. 

离太阳更近，金星上的水蒸发了。

Since water vapor is a greenhouse gas, this humid atmosphere, perhaps denser than Earth's present-day atmosphere, but far less dense than the atmosphere that envelops Venus today would have efficiently trapped heat from the Sun. 

水蒸气是温室气体，大气密度大，留住来自太阳的热量。

At first, this would have had little effect on the oceans of Venus. 

对金星上的海影响不大

Although the temperature would have climbed above 100° C, the boiling point of water at sea level on Earth, the added atmospheric pressure from water vapor would have kept the water in Venus' oceans in the liquid state.

增加的大气压会是金星上的海保持液态



### p5

This hot and humid state of affairs may have persisted for several hundred million years. 

持续很长时间

> persist vi. 持续

But as the Sun's energy output slowly increased over time, the temperature at the surface would eventually have risen above 374°C. 

温度上升到374

Above this temperature, no matter what the atmospheric pressure, Venus' oceans would have begun to evaporate, and the added water vapor in the atmosphere would have increased the greenhouse effect.

海水开始气化，增加的水汽会强化温室效应。

> vapor [ˈveɪpər] 
>
> evaporate [ɪˈvæpəreɪt] 

This would have made the temperature even higher and caused the oceans to evaporate faster, producing more water vapor. 

温度越高，越多水蒸发

That, in turn, would have further intensified the greenhouse effect and made the temperature climb higher still.

温度变更高

### p6

Once Venus' oceans disappeared, so did the `mechanism` for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. 

这个方法也移除了co2

> mechanism [c] a method or a system for achieving sth 方法；机制
>
> so adv. 也 Times have changed, so have I.
>
> adv. 的确如此 You were there, too. so I was.

With no oceans to dissolve it, outgassed carbon dioxide began to accumulate in the atmosphere, intensifying the greenhouse effect even more. 

没有海去溶解co2，被排出的co2开始在大气内积累，加强了温室效应。

Temperatures eventually became high enough to "bake out" any carbon dioxide that was trapped in carbonate rocks. 

温度高-》在碳酸盐石头里的co2也排出了

This liberated carbon dioxide formed the thick atmosphere of present-day Venus. 

自由的co2形成了如今金星厚重的大气

Over time, the rising temperatures would have `leveled off`, solar ultraviolet radiation having broken down atmospheric water vapor molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, With all the water vapor gone, the greenhouse effect would no longer have accelerated.

太阳紫外线辐射分解水汽，变成氢气和氧气，水汽消失，温室效应也不再积累，最后温度就保持不变了。
