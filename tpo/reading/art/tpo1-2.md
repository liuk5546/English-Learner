# The Origins of Theater

## [error 2] 

In seeking to describe the origins of theater, one must rely primarily on `speculation`, since there is little `concrete` evidence on which to `draw`. The most widely accepted theory, championed by anthropologists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, `envisions` theater `as` emerging out of myth and ritual. The process `perceived` by these anthropologists may be summarized briefly. During the early `stages` of *its* development, a society becomes aware of forces that appear to influence or control its food supply and well-being. **Having little understanding of natural causes, it attributes both desirable and undesirable occurrences to supernatural or magical forces, and it searches for means to win the favor of these forces. **Perceiving an apparent connection between certain actions performed by the group and the result it desires, the group repeats, refines, and formalizes those actions into fixed ceremonies, or rituals.

剧院的起源，主要靠假设，应为没具体证据研究。剧院来源于神话和宗教。在早期社会发展的舞台，它意识到看起来影响和控制社会的食物供应和健康的力量。人们对自然因素一无所知，这将欲望和非欲望的事情归因于超自然和魔法的力量。并且社会寻找能战胜这些力量的方法。

Stories (myths) may then grow up around a ritual. Frequently the myths include representatives of those supernatural forces that the rites celebrate or hope to influence. Performers may wear costumes and masks to represent the mythical characters or supernatural forces in the rituals or in accompanying celebrations. As a people becomes more sophisticated, its conceptions of supernatural forces and `causal` relationships may change. As a result, it may abandon or modify some rites. But the myths that have grown up around the rites may continue as part of the group's oral tradition and may even come to be acted out under conditions divorced from these rites. When this occurs, the first step has been taken toward theater as an autonomous activity, and thereafter entertainment and aesthetic values may gradually replace the former mystical and socially efficacious concerns.

Although origin in ritual has long been the most popular, it is by no means the only theory about how the theater `came into being`. Storytelling has been proposed as one alternative. Under this theory, relating and listening to stories are seen as fundamental human pleasures. Thus, the recalling of an event (a hunt, battle, or other feat) is elaborated through the narrator's pantomime and impersonation and eventually through each role being assumed by a different person.

A closely related theory sees theater as evolving out of dances that are primarily pantomimic, rhythmical or gymnastic, or from imitations of animal noises and sounds. Admiration for the performer's skill, virtuosity, and grace are seen as motivation for `elaborating` the activities into fully realized `theatrical performances`.

In addition to exploring the possible `antecedents` of theater, scholars have also theorized about the motives that led people to develop theater. Why did theater develop, and why was it valued after it ceased to fulfill the function of ritual? Most answers fall back on the theories about the human mind and basic human needs. One, set forth by Aristotle in the fourth century B.C.,sees humans as naturally `imitative`-as taking pleasure in imitating persons, things, and actions and in seeing such imitations. Another, advanced in the twentieth century, suggests that humans have a gift for fantasy, through which they seek to reshape reality into more satisfying forms than those encountered in daily life. Thus, fantasy or fiction (of which drama is one form) permits people to `objectify` their anxieties and fears, confront them, and fulfill their hopes in fiction if not fact. The theater, then, is one tool whereby people define an world or escape from unpleasant realities.

除了探索剧院可能的祖先之外，学者们还理论化导致人们发展剧院的动机。为什么剧院发展，为什么在它停止起宗教仪式的作用后依然有价值？大多数的回答都与人类思想和需要有关。人类天生好模仿和幻想。剧院是一个工具，人们通过他定义一个世界或者逃离不喜欢的现实。



But neither the human imitative instinct nor a penchant for fantasy by itself leads to an autonomous theater. Therefore, additional explanations are needed. One necessary condition seems to be a somewhat detached view of human problems. For example, one sign of this condition is the appearance of the comic vision, since comedy requires sufficient detachment to view some deviations from social norms as ridiculous rather than as serious threats to the welfare of the entire group. Another condition that contributes to the development of autonomous theater is the emergence of the aesthetic sense. **For example, some early societies ceased to consider certain rites essential to their well-being and abandoned them; nevertheless, they retained as parts of their `oral` tradition the myths that had grown up around the rites and admired them for their artistic qualities rather than for their religious usefulness.**

上面两个理论都不能导致一个独立的剧院。一个必要的情况似乎是一种人类问题分离的观点。另一个必要的条件是美感的出现。

一些早期的社会停止认为特定的仪式对他们的健康非常重要，并且废除了这些仪式。然而他们保留了神话。
