#Visiting the Washington Monument.   

##Dialogue 1  
Mark: Well Jingjing, what do you think?  It's a lot less crowded than the White House.  
> a lot less crowded than sth  比。。。人少多了  

Jingjing: It is a lot less crowded than the White House. There's a lot more open space at least.  
> open space 空地  

Mark:  Would you like to try to get in?  
> 想不想进去 go in/enter  

Jingjing:  Yeah.  Let's go see what we're dealing with.  
> deal with 要处理的（比如进入纪念碑前，把打火机丢掉）  

Mark:  Bad news: the lift **is closed for repairs**.  There was an earthquake several years ago, and it's still being fixed.  The good news is not too many people want to climb all the stairs.  
> be closed for repairs 关闭维修  
> an earthquake  

Jingjing:  Do you feel like getting a workout?  
> feel like doing 想要做某事  
> workout n. 锻炼。

Mark:  I'm up for it, if you'd like to see a spectacular view.  
> be up for sth 同意某事  
> spectacular 宏伟壮观的  

Jingjing:  It's probably worth it.  Let's deal with security and get started on those stairs.  

Jingjing:  Wow, it didn't look that tall from the outside.  How much farther?  
> 还有多远。  

Mark:  You know what?  I didn't bother to check before we started. There was a big plaque with lots of information.  I only remember some of it.  
> not bother to do 没有费事做某事  
> plaque 牌（sign）  
> let's take a photo beside the stone plaque.  

Jingjing:  Well, you'd better be helping me keep my mind off my knees if you told me some of that stuff.  
> keep one's mind off sth.让某人的大脑不去想某物  
> 

Mark:  Sure.  It took forty years to build this.  Most of that time was a stall in construction though.  
> stall 台子  
> in construction  

Jingjing:  Really, I heard it's still the tallest obelisk in the world.  
> obelisk 方尖纪念碑  

Mark:  Yeah, and it was the tallest structure in the world for just about one year.  

Jingjing:  Ha ha.  It took such a long time to set a record for such a short time.  What ended up being taller?  
> set a record 创纪录  

Mark:  The Eiffel Tower.  Oh, look, there's more light up ahead.  I think we're finally near the top.  
> Eiffel Tower 埃菲尔铁塔  
> up ahead 在前面  

##Dialogue 2  
Jingjing:  Wow, what an incredible view!  
> 风景也太美了  
> incredible  

Mark:  Yeah, we take for granted being able to go to the top of tall buildings.  But people a hundred years ago only had this as their chance to be 170 meters off the ground.  
> take sth for granted 认为。。。使理所当然的  

Jingjing:  This and the Eiffel Tower, right?  

Mark:  Yeah.  It's too bad we can only see through these narrow slits in the stone.  
> slits in the stone 石头的窄缝  

Jingjing:  Hmm, but the good thing is there aren't so many other tall buildings around.  I can see the whole city.  

Mark:  The land in Washington D.C. is at a pretty low elevation. I read that they had to drain a swamp to build the city here.  
> 华盛顿的海拔挺低的，我读到过他们不得不抽干一个沼泽地来建城。    

Jingjing:  That would explain why there are so many lakes and waterways.  

Mark:  Jingjing, come over to this side.  You can see the Lincoln Memorial.  
> come over to there 过来  

Jingjing:  Wow, it looks so small from up here.  And, when we were there just half an hour ago, it looked huge.  

Mark:  There's still one more side to view.  Oh, the Capitol building is not that far away either.  

Jingjing:  Would you like to head over there next?  
> head over 去

Mark:  Sure, if you can put off eating until afterwards.  We'll probably catch it in the afternoon light if we start walking soon.  
> put off 推迟  
> in the afternoon light 在下午光线最好的时候  
> afterwards `adv`以后；后来  

Jingjing:  Alright.  Let's get started on the way down those stairs.
