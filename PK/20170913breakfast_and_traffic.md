#Business English : Breakfast and traffic  

##Dialogue 1  
Jingjing:  Good morning, Mark.  
Have you eaten breakfast already?
京晶：早上好，马克。您吃过早餐了吗？


Mark:  Yes.  I did.  Because of the time difference, I got up super early.
马克：吃过了。因为有时差，今天起得特别早。
> time difference 时差  
> jet lag 

Jingjing:  Oh, you should have texted me to come meet you earlier!
京晶：噢，那您应该早一点发信息让我过来接您。 
> should have done 你早就应该做某事  

Mark:  That's alright.  It gave me a chance to catch up on some work and go for a morning walk.
马克：没事的。这也给了我一个机会赶完一些工作，还散了个晨步。
> catch up on some work  
> 赶工作  
> go for a morning walk

Jingjing:  Oh, so you got to see some of Beijing already.
京晶：哦，看来您已经欣赏了一部分北京的样子。


Mark:  Well, it wasn't exactly a tour.  Anyway, I got your text. Thanks for making the arrangements for me to visit your office.
马克：那个，倒也不是观光。对了，我收到您的信息了。感谢您为我安排前去访问您的办公室。

Jingjing:  No problem.  We thought it'd be nice to introduce you around, take you out for lunch.  Then, just as I said in the text, I'm available to take you to one of the famous historical sites.
京晶：没问题。我们曾想最好是把您介绍给大家，带您出去吃午餐。然后，就像我刚才在短信里说的，我有时间可以带您去一个北京著名的名胜古迹。


Mark:  I think the Temple of Heaven would be best.  From what I read about it, it's not too far away, not too crowded—great for a quick afternoon.  That way, we can focus on business.
马克：我觉得天坛是最好的选择。从我了解到的来看，这地方不远，也不拥挤——对于一个时间并不太充裕的下午来说简直完美。这样的话，我们就可以专注在我们的生意事宜上。

Jingjing:  Ok.  Well, I have the car waiting out front.  Are you ready to head out now?
京晶：好的。我已经让车在外面等着了。您准备好出发了吗？



Mark:  Sure.  How far is it to the office?
马克：好了。这里离公司有多远？

Jingjing:  It should take us half an hour, 45 minutes tops.  Traffic was pretty light on my way over.
京晶：应该花我们半小时吧，最多45分钟。我来的路上路况挺顺的。


Mark:  That's reasonable.  Let me just make sure I have everything... Yep, let's get started.
马克：有道理。让我检查一下我东西都带齐了…好的，我们出发吧。
Jingjing:  It's that silver SUV just outside the door.
京晶：就是门外那辆银色的SUV.


Mark:  Oh, it's a different car from yesterday evening.
马克：哦，和昨晚那辆不一样。
Jingjing:  Yeah.  We have a small fleet.
京晶：是的。我们有个小车队。
