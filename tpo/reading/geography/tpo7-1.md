# The Geologic History of the Mediterranean

## 地中海的地理历史

In 1970 geologists Kenneth J. Hsu and William B.F.Ryan were collecting research data while aboard the oceanographic research vessel Glomar Challenger. An objective of this particular cruise was to investigate the floor of the Mediterranean and to resolve questions about its geologic history. One question was related to evidence that the invertebrate fauna (animals without spines) of the Mediterranean had changed abruptly about 6 million years ago. Most of the older organisms were nearly wiped out, although a few hardy species survived. A few managed to migrate into the Atlantic. Somewhat later, the migrants returned, bringing new species with them. Why did the near extinction and migrations occur?

1970年地理学家Hsu和Ryan收集研究数据。这次特别的航行的其中一个目的就是探究地中海海底和解决它的地理历史问题。地中海无脊椎动物六百万年前突然改变了。虽然一些hardy species活下来了，大多数古生物消失。一些hardy species迁入大西洋。之后，迁出的生物回来了，带着一些新的物种。为什么这场近灭绝和迁徙会发生呢？

Another task for the Glomar Challenger's scientists was to try to determine the origin of the domelike masses buried deep beneath the Mediterranean seafloor. These structures had been detected years earlier by echo-sounding instruments, but they had never been penetrated in the `course` of `drilling`. **Were they salt domes such as are common along the United States Gulf Coast**, and if so, why should there have been so much solid crystalline salt beneath the floor of the Mediterranean?

另外一个任务是确定domelike masses 的起源。这个结构几年前探测清楚了，但是他们从来没有穿透。他们是盐顶吗? 如果常见，为什么地中海的海底有如此之多的盐晶体？

With question such as these clearly before them, the scientists aboard the Glomar Challenger processed to the Mediterranean to search for the answers. On August 23, 1970, they recovered a sample. The sample consisted of pebbles of hardened sediment that had once been soft, deep-sea mud, as well as granules of gypsum and fragments of volcanic rock. **Not a single pebble was found that might have indicated that the pebbles came from the nearby continent.** In the days following, samples of solid gypsum were repeatedly brought on deck as drilling operations penetrated the seafloor. Furthermore, the gypsum was found to possess peculiarities of composition and structure that suggested it had formed on desert flats. Sediment above and below the gypsum layer contained tiny marine fossils, indicating `open-ocean conditions`. As they drilled into the central and deepest part of the Mediterranean basin, the scientists took solid, shiny, crystalline salt from the core barrel. `Interbedded` with the salt were thin layers of what appeared to be windblown silt.  

1、科学家去地中海寻找前面两个问题的答案；2、发现样本 ；3、沉淀物曾经是土

4、不来自附近的大陆；5、后来发现固体的gypsum；6、gypsum形成与desert flats；7、在gypsum上下有海洋化石；8、中层和深层是晶体盐; 9、盐中含有windblown silt？？？？
