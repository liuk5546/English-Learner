## 17世纪欧洲经济增长

（1）

In the late sixteenth century and into the seventeenth, Europe continued the growth that had lifted it `out of` the relatively less prosperous medieval period (from the mid 400s to the late 1400s). Among the key factors behind this growth were increased agricultural productivity and an expansion of trade.

Much of the potential for European economic development lay in what `at first glance` would seem to have been only sleepy villages. Such villages, however, generally lay in regions of relatively advanced agricultural production, `permitting` not only the survival of `peasants` but also the accumulation of an agricultural surplus for investment. They had access to urban `merchants`, markets, and trade routes.

许多欧洲经济发展的潜力存在于那些第一眼看起来只是沉睡的山村。然而，这样的山村存在于农业生产相对高级的地方，这使得不仅农民活下来了，而且农业过剩投资的积累。农民已经可以接触到城市批发商，市场和贸易路径。
