Now, in Europe, in the Middle Ages, before the invention of printing and the printing press, all books, all manuscripts, were handmade.  

And the material typically used for the pages was parchment, which is animal skin that’s stretched and dried under tension, so it becomes really flat and can be written on.  
> parchment 专有名词解释：是被拉长晾干的动物皮肤。平整，可以书写。  
> stretch `v.`  
> 拉长；拽宽to make sth longer, wider or looser  
> Is there any way of stretching shoes?  
> 有什么办法能把鞋子撑大吗？  

During the 1400s, when printing was being developed, paper became the predominant material for books in Europe, but prior to that, it was parchment.  
> predominant  
> `adj.` having more power or influence than others 主导的  
> a predominant culture 主流文化  
> prior to  
> adj. = before  
> prior knowledge 先前的知识  

Parchment is durable—much more so than paper.And it could be reused, which came in handy since it was a costly material and in short supply.  
> so much more than = much more so than  
> 因为parchment是一种昂贵的材料且供应短缺，所以它能重复使用是非常便利的。  
> handy  
> 便利的  
> costly  
> 昂贵的  

So it wasn’t uncommon for the scribes, or monks, who produced the manuscripts— uh remember, before printing, books were made mainly in monasteries— well, the scribes often recycled the parchment that’d been used for earlier manuscripts.They simply erased the ink off the parchment and wrote something new in its place.A manuscript page that was written on, erased, and then used again is called a palimpsest.  
> palimpsest 又出现专有名词：一种手抄页面，这种页面被写下，擦去，然后再次使用。
