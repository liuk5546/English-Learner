##tpo 20: The "let it burn" policy  
&emsp;&emsp;In the United States, it had been common practice since the late 1960s not to `suppress` natural forest fires. The "let it burn" policy assumed that forest fires would `burn themselves out` quickly, without causing much damage. However, in the summer of 1988, forest fires in Yellowstone, the most famous national park in the country, burned for more than two months and spread over a huge area, `encompassing` more than 800,000 acres. Because of the large `scale` of the damage, many people called for replacing the "let it burn" policy with a policy of `extinguishing` forest fires as soon as they appeared. Three kinds of damage caused by the "let it burn" policy were emphasized by critics of the policy.  
> suppress `[sə'pres]`  
> to prevent sth from growing, developing or continuing. 压制；阻止；抑制。  
> it is common practice (not) to do sth.  
> 做某事是通常的做法。

> 自己熄灭

**Actually, fires are a natural part of the ecological cycle, and their role is not just destructive, but also creative. That's why the "let it burn" policy is fundamentally a good one, even if it sometimes causes fires on the scale of the 1988 Yellowstone fire. Let's look at what happened after the '88 fire.**

&emsp;&emsp;First, Yellowstone fires caused tremendous damage to the park's trees and other vegetation. When the fires finally `died out`, nearly one third of Yellowstone's land had been `scorched`. Trees were `charred` and blackened from `flames` and smoke. Smaller plants were entirely `incinerated`. What had been a national treasure now seemed like a `devastated` wasteland.

中心观点：黄石大火导致树木植被损毁。  
**First, vegetation. As you might imagine, scorched areas were in time colonized by new plants. As a matter of fact, the plant life in Yellowstone became more diverse, because the fire created an opportunity for certain plants that could not grow otherwise. For example: areas where the trees had been destroyed by the fire could now be taken over by smaller plants that needed open, unshaded space to grow. And another example: seeds of certain plant species won't germinate unless they're exposed to very high levels of heat, so those plants started appearing after the fire as well.**  
> colonize `['kɑlə.naɪz]`  
> vt. to live or grow in large numbers in a particular area.  
> diverse ` [daɪ'vɜrs]`  
> 多样化的

&emsp;&emsp;Second, the park wildlife was affected as well. Large animals like deer and elk were seen `fleeing` the fire. Many smaller species were probably unable to escape. There was also `concern` that the destruction of habitats and the `disruption` of food chains would make it impossible for the animals that survived the fire to return.

> disruption 
> 扰乱；中断

&emsp;&emsp;Third, the fires `compromised` the value of the park as a tourist attraction, which `in turn` had negative consequences for the local economy. With several thousand acres of the park `engulfed` in flames, the tourist season was cut short, and a large number of visitors decided to stay away. Of course, local businesses that depended on park visitors suffered as a result.

## tpo 19:Controversy of buzzing  
&emsp;&emsp;Many consumers ignore commercial advertisements. In response, advertising companies have started using a new tactic, called “buzzing.” The advertisers hire people—buzzers—who personally promote (buzz) products to people they know or meet. The key part is that the buzzers do not reveal that they are being paid to promote anything. They behave as though they were just spontaneously praising a product during normal conversation. Buzzing has generated a lot of controversy, and many critics would like to see it banned.  

&emsp;&emsp;First, the critics complain that consumers should know whether a person praising a product is being paid to praise the product. Knowing this makes a big difference: we expect the truth from people who we believe do not have any motive for misleading us. But with buzzing what you hear is just paid advertising, which may well give a person incorrect information about the buzzed product.  

&emsp;&emsp;Second, since buzzers pretend they are just private individuals, consumers listen to their endorsements less critically than they should. With advertisements in print or on TV, the consumer is on guard for `questionable claims or empty descriptions` such as “new and improved.” But when consumers do not know they are being lobbied, they may accept claims they would otherwise be suspicious of. This may suit the manufacturers, but it could really harm consumers.  

因为buzzer假装他们是私人，顾客听他们的宣传有更少的批判性。消费者对于报纸或者电视上的广告有提防，因为有问题的断言和空洞的口号。但是当消费者不知道他们被推销了，他们也许会接受这些话他们原本怀疑的话。这一点适合制造商，但伤害了消费者。  
> on guard  
> 提防  
> endorsement  
> n. 宣传

**Second, the passage argues that consumers listen to buzzers's endorsements less critically than they should. Bill holds the opposite. People whom he talks to always ask a lot of questions such as the price, service, and how long he has used the product. They won't buy the product, if buzzers have no good answers.**  
> hold the opposite  不同意

&emsp;&emsp;And worst of all is the harmful effect that buzzing is likely to have on social relationships. Once we become aware that people we meet socially may be buzzers with a hidden agenda, we will become less trustful of people in general. So buzzing will result in the spread of mistrust and the expectation of dishonesty.
