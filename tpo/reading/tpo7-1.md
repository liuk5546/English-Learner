# The Geologic History of the Mediterranean

## 地中海的地理历史

In 1970 geologists Kenneth J. Hsu and William B.F.Ryan were collecting research data while aboard the oceanographic research vessel Glomar Challenger. An objective of this particular cruise was to investigate the floor of the Mediterranean and to resolve questions about its geologic history. One question was related to evidence that the invertebrate fauna (animals without spines) of the Mediterranean had changed abruptly about 6 million years ago. Most of the older organisms were nearly wiped out, although a few hardy species survived. A few managed to migrate into the Atlantic. Somewhat later, the migrants returned, bringing new species with them. Why did the near extinction and migrations occur?

1970年地理学家Hsu和Ryan收集研究数据。这次特别的航行的其中一个目的就是探究地中海海底和解决它的地理历史问题。地中海无脊椎动物六百万年前突然改变了。虽然一些hardy species活下来了，大多数古生物消失。一些hardy species迁入大西洋。之后，迁出的生物回来了，带着一些新的物种。为什么这场近灭绝和迁徙会发生呢？



Another task for the Glomar Challenger's scientists was to try to determine the origin of the domelike masses buried deep beneath the Mediterranean seafloor. These structures had been detected years earlier by echo-sounding instruments, but they had never been penetrated in the `course` of `drilling`. **Were they salt domes such as are common along the United States Gulf Coast**, and if so, why should there have been so much solid crystalline salt beneath the floor of the Mediterranean?

另外一个任务是确定domelike masses 的起源。这个结构几年前探测清楚了，但是他们从来没有穿透。他们是盐顶吗? 如果常见，为什么地中海的海底有如此之多的盐晶体？
