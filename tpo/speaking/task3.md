Now listen to part ot a lecture on this topic in a business management class.

Professor

So let me tell you about my own experience with this when I was working for a computer company a couple of years ago. So one day, **a coworker and I suggested we should give our computers a design makeover**, make them look more up to date. Market research was showing that new customers said they would be more interested in buying our computers if they looked cooler. Our technology was advanced, but the outside design looked really old-fashioned.

> makeover [c,u]外观的改进或改善

At first, **more than half the group supported us**. There were a few **senior managers** there though who **didn't support the design change**. One of the senior managers said, "Our focus has always been on technology. Changing the look is an unnecessary cost." Almost immediately, **some of our supporters changed their minds**. Even my coworker changed his mind. When I asked him why after the meeting, he told me **he didn't want to make a bad impression on the senior managers**. He thought that disagreeing with them might **jeopardize his chances of getting a promotion** by not looking like a team player.

> been `[bɪn]`

What about me? I hate to admit it, but after a few hours of discussion, I started wondering if it was worth everyone's time to argue about this. As more people sided with senior management, **I started to feel like I was the only one holding up the vote. **Everyone else seemed to think change wasn't necessary, so I voted against my own idea in the end. So we `unanimously` decided to stay with the current old-looking design. But this decision **ended up costing us a lot of money**. That same year, our competitor came out with a new design that attracted some of our customers and prevented us from profiting on potential new customers.

让我们来说说高速公路广告牌，为一辆名叫Panther的车打广告。这个广告展示了一幅巨大的车画，在车上用大大的字母写着车的名字--Panther。

Well, to be specific, let's say there's a billboard on the highway advertising a ... car, called the 'Panther'. The ad shows a big picture of a car and above the car in huge letters is the name of the car- 'Panther'. 

> advertise vt 宣传，展现

但是问这些司机他们是否看到任何车子的广告，他们会想一会儿，然后说‘没有’

But ask those drivers later if they saw any advertisements for cars, and well, they'll think about it and a lot of them will say 'no'. 



你让他们说出以p开头的动物名字。

You ask them to name an animal starting with the letter 'p'. 



这块广告牌有影响即使这些司机没有记着曾经看过。

The billboard had an effect even though the drivers don't remember ever seeing it.

An establishing shot is an image shown briefly at the beginning of a scene, usually taken from far away, that is used to provide context for the rest of the scene.

> context 背景，上下文

So, the other day I went to this great new movie, and one of the scenes in particular I thought was really `set up` nicely . At the start of the scene, before the action and talking and things started, you saw, on the movie screen, an image of a city. You could tell it was a big city. There were lots of buildings, tall ones, skyscrapers. And the cars and signs on the city streets looked old-fashioned, like they were from the past, like the 1940s. The other thing I noticed right away from this first image, just when the scene started, was that the city seemed gloomy. You couldn't see much because it was, well, there was mostly darkness rather than sunlight. And there was only just a little bit of light from the street `lamps`. On top of that, it was raining, and kind of foggy. All of these details worked together to create a dark, gloomy, mysterious feeling. So then when the action started, and it showed detectives talking to each other in an office, I already knew that the office was located in a tall building in a big city sometime in the 1940s. And I had a good idea that the events that would be taking place would be pretty dark and mysterious because of the shot, the image I saw at the beginning of the scene.

参考答案：

An establishing shot is an image shown briefly at the beginning of a scene, which is used to provide context for the rest of the scene. For example, the other day the professor `went to a great new movie`. At the start of the scene, he saw an image of a big city with old fashioned car like being from the 1940s. And he noticed the city `seemed` gloomy. So when the action started, and it showed detective talking, the professor knew that the office was located in a tall building in a big city `sometime` in the 1940s, and the events would be  pretty dark and `mysterious` because of the image at the begining of the movie.

Entertainment merchandising is a form of marketing in which the brand or image from one product is also used to sell another.

EM是一种营销形式，在这种营销形式中，来自一个产品的品牌或形象也被用来推另一种产品。

OK, so I’ve actually got a few different examples of this. You know when I was kid, a character named Action Hero was really popular with my friends and me. We would always watch the Action Hero program on television every week, and played games, pretending that we were strong and powerful as he was. Then pretty soon we began seeing this small Action Hero figures in all the stores. And well we all just had to have them. I mean we’d been watching the television show for so long that it seemed only natural to want to own the toys too.

Well I finally grew up and left the Action Hero television program and toys behind. But now I have a **seven-year-old daughter** who watches television a lot and also likes to play with her toys. And lately her **favorite toy** is a cute little baby doll with a big round face and lots of curly hair named **Rosa**. All my daughters’ friends have Rosa dolls too. And they enjoy going to each other’s houses to play with them. Then a **few weeks** ago, my daughter came running up to me all excited because she had just heard there was going to be a **new television program** on every week with the doll Rosa as **the main character**. So naturally she and all her friends have begun watching the show. And it’s already very popular, as popular as the toy doll.

Darger's picture looks more cluttered,more crowded with details than the pictures of other artists because its entire surface's painted and there are no spaces left empty.

参考：Outside Artist is a people who produce outside artist-work in isolation from other artists and have little or no formal artistic training.

Henry Darger is an outside artist who had no friend and never formally studied art. For example, In one piece, he illustrates a story about the adventures of seven children. But Dager had a really hard time drawing human figures, so he cut out pictures of children from newspapers and magazines and pasted them into his own painted illustration. As a result. it looks a little strange. This is because that the painting looks more crowded with detials and a lot longer than the pictures of most other artists.
